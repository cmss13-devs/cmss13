This is the codebase for the CM-SS13 flavoured fork of SpaceStation 13

Space Station 13 is a paranoia-laden round-based roleplaying game set against the backdrop of a nonsensical, metal death trap masquerading as a space station, with charming spritework designed to represent the sci-fi setting and its dangerous undertones. Have fun, and survive! CM-SS13 has wildly adapted this idea into a strategic roleplay-based team deathmatch game.

## :exclamation: How to compile :exclamation:

On **2022-04-06** we have changed the way to compile the codebase.

**The quick way**. Find `bin/server.cmd` in this folder and double click it to automatically build and host the server on port 1337.

**The long way**. Find `bin/build.cmd` in this folder, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile. If it closes, it means it has finished its job. You can then set up the server normally by opening `ColonialMarinesALPHA.dmb` in DreamDaemon.

**Building ColonialMarinesALPHA in DreamMaker directly is now deprecated and might produce errors**, such as `'tgui.bundle.js': cannot find file`.
