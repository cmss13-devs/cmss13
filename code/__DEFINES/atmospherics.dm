This is the divisor which comes into play when the human's loc temperature is lower than their body temperature. Make it lower to lose bodytemp faster.
#define BODYTEMP_HEAT_DIVISOR 6 //Similar to the BODYTEMP_AUTORECOVERY_DIVISOR, but this is the divisor which is applied at the stage that follows autorecovery.
