	Cellular automaton explosions!

	Often in life, you can't have what you wish for. This is one massive, huge,
	gigantic, gaping exception. With this, you get EVERYTHING you wish for.

	This thing is AWESOME. It's made with super simple rules, and it still produces
	highly complex explosions because it's simply emergent behavior from the rules.
	If that didn't amaze you (it should), this also means the code is SUPER short,
	and because cellular automata is handled by a subsystem, this doesn't cause
	lagspikes at all.

	Enough nerd enthusiasm about this. Here's how it actually works:

		1. You start the explosion off with a given power

		2. The explosion begins to propagate outwards in all 8 directions

		3. Each time the explosion propagates, it loses power_falloff power

		4. Each time the explosion propagates, atoms in the tile the explosion is in
		   may reduce the power of the explosion by their explosive resistance

	That's it. There are some special rules, though, namely:

		* If the explosion occured in a wall, the wave is strengthened
		  with power *= reflection_multiplier and reflected back in the
		  direction it came from

		* If two explosions meet, they will either merge into an amplified
		  or weakened explosion
