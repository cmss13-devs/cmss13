An unknown alien surprised you and the rest of your garrison, slaughtering effectively everyone. Just as you were about to escape, it caught you in a trap, and dragged you into the darkness.

One night, your barracks got blown up before your very eyes while on guard duty, and to your dismay, it was not a terrorist. You attempted to gun the monster down, but failed, your friends torn apart before your very eyes. Being the last one alive, the thing takes you with it, shackles you, and throws you into a cell.
