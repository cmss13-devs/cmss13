	desc = "Like the Colonial Liberation Front and the better-equipped Freelancer Mercenaries before them, the Dozens start with non-standard UA weaponry, employing equipment of the United Americas such as the M16A2 assault rifle and the minigun. While the weapons on their own are outdated and cannot take most attachments, their automatic weaponry is equally deadly, meant for hunting their targets. \
	The Dozens will also expect a guerrilla style of gameplay, as unlike most modern forces of this era, the Dozens use special techniques related to survival and can handle themselves on the ground without support. Whether it would take place in a jungle landscape or in urban grounds. One advantage of the Dutch's Mercenary Team is their speed and aggressiveness, which are primarily used to eliminate their target(s), due to the target's equal amount of speed, aggressiveness and robustness."
