	desc = "The Holy Order of the High-Explosive Fragmenting-Antipersonnel hand grenade (also known as the HEFA Knights, the Knights of HEFA, and or the HEFA Order), is a religious cult that is actively opposed to the United Americas and the Union of Progressive Peoples. \
	The Order's operations are loosely coordinated between two cell types, a 'temple' group, acting as a dispatch and administration center, and a 'shard' or more traditionally described splinter that actually carries out the strike. \
	It is believed that all HEFA Knight 'temple' cells operate out of the derelict Kerchner 2155 Horn Nebula mining expedition way-stations due to their proximity to supply lanes leading to the Neroid sector and other frontier sectors. The group is classified as an intergalactic terrorist organization by both the UPP, and UA. \
	HEFA Knight members or Shrapnelsworn, are devoted to the worship of the M40 High-Explosive Fragmenting-Antipersonnel hand grenade, viewing the object as a divine gift from an unknown benefactor that has influenced humanity. Order members are trained to have no regard for their personal safety. To die in battle is to die gloriously, and to solidify one's devotion to the HEFA hand grenade."
