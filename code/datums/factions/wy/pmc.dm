	desc = "Weyland-Yutani PMCs are military personnel owned and operated by the company. They are equipped with advanced modern military equipment and weaponry akin to the USCM and similar national militaries. The tasks of the PMCs are never limited to one specific job and they are often deployed on 'shadow missions'. Their deployment is often kept secret from the USCM to avoid conflict with the anti-corporate officers in the USCM. The recruitment process largely consists of those who have personal contacts with higher Weyland-Yutani employees, or those who have caught the eye of the superiors and been hand-picked. The superiors value abilities in the field and willingness to obey company directives, for a large sum of money, despite of their moral beliefs. Following the defeat of the Dust Raiders and the withdrawal of the United Americas of the Neroid sector, a group of employees became skilled mercenaries. They are part of Weyland-Yutani's Task Force Oberon that was stationed aboard the USCSS Royce, a powerful Weyland-Yutani cruiser that patrols the outer edges of the Neroid sector. Under the directive of Weyland-Yutani's board member Johan Almric, they act as private security for company science teams. The USCSS Royce contains a crew of roughly two hundred PMCs, and one hundred scientists and support personnel. Rumors say that a Weyland-Yutani Special Task Force known as \"Royal\" of the USCSS Lunalorne are part of a different specialization, designed to capture anomalies associated with alien and supernatural life."
