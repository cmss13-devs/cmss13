	title = "RE: I want out."
	entry_text = {"<html>
					Okay, yep, I know what you're saying. Stilettos aren't safe, you want out of my sharp stick business,
					and sooner or later we're going to get hung upside down from our ankles by the MPs, stuffed in a freezer
					in the lower decks, and tossed to the nearest military tribunal in a sack in six to eight weeks.
					<br>
					<br>
					Maybe that reserve grunt in Echo Company just about gutted himself with one of our blades in his bunk,
					and maybe one of them accidently got flashed in front of one of the officers during a 'disagreement',
					but neither of those things are 'explicitly' OUR faults.
					<br>
					<br>
					I know you could just as easily fashion your
					metalworking equipment towards making canteens for PFC Marshall's little business, or helping those jackass
					flyboys spruce up their tin cans, but you need to realize we occupy a market nobody else on the ship is filling.
					We'll talk about it when we're next woken for shore leave in a month, but I personally think you're making a huge
					mistake trying to opt out.
					<br>
					<br>
					I know a dozen men in the battalion who claim your stilettos pulled them out of trouble.
					Doesn't matter if they're being used to open MREs in a jam, or save one of our guys from some yokel colonist
					with a carving knife, we're doing more than just lining our pockets- we're doing a service for the men of the corps.
					<br>
					<br>
					Keep that in mind.

/datum/fluff_email/almayer/thermalcloak
	title = "M68 Thermal Cloak."
	entry_text = {"<html>
					Are you sure these things are safe, man? I just tried one on during a training exercise back at Bernice 378, took a wrong turn,
					and wound up on an outdoor firing range being used by another Battalion (5th "Hammerheads" I think?). Now typically, somebody would have spotted me,
					the range officer would have called for a ceasefire, the captain gives me a slap on the wrist, and I claim 'emotional trauma' and get served warm cookies
					and milk by the base psychiatrist.
					<br>
					<br>
					But this time, they kept firing their howling pulse rifles downrange even with me there. I hit the turf the moment
					I realized what was happening, but the rounds kept screaming overhead. My armor got snagged in the thermal cloak (couldn't get the damn thing free),
					so I had to roll myself sideways until I was clear. Turns out later I cracked a rib (didn't realize it from all the adrenaline I was pumping at the time),
					and bruised my skin so badly it turned purple. I get these cloaks are supposed to keep us concealed, but what about the rounds from our own guys?
					<br>
					<br>
					If you'd ask me what I was afraid of more, a squad of our own guys or the entire insurrection on Linna 349, I've since changed my answer.

	title = "Snow? Where the hell is all the snow?"
	entry_text = {"<html>
					Why were we issued these damn snow uniforms in the first place? We've been around the sector almost three dozen times and we've
					yet to put them to use. They even issued us bulky kits to repaint our rifles, pistols and shotguns to match the cold weather gear,
					and masks to keep us warm. But what's the point? They're just taking up a forth of the cargo hold, half infested with moths we picked
					up six months ago from Bernice 378 (that base is a sanitation nightmare), and they need to be steamed on a regular basis.
					<br>
					<br>
					For all the effort it's been worth to me, the moment the "Falling Falcons" have the misfortune of falling on what is probably
					the last ice planet in the galaxy, I'm making sure we stay there for another two cycles.

/datum/fluff_email/almayer/hawaianpizza
	title = "Hawaiian Pizza in the MREs?"
	entry_text = {"<html>
					I swear this must have been a joke, but the other day I opened up my MRE packet to come face to face with a 'Hawaiian Pizza" packet.
					Of course, I had already cut the seal open (otherwise I'd have fenced it to the Damien twins from Bravo Squad and have retired by now),
					but the smell was horrendous! I guess pineapple just doesn't stow well. I neglected to check the date, but it must have been an old issue,
					otherwise we'd have seen one by now. Either that, or those chinophiles in Task Force Eridani and those prissy boys in Task Force Sol haven't
					been sharing the full menu with us Task Force Herculis folks.
					<br>
					<br>
					PS: The supply sergeant's grandparents are from Naples. Don't let him hear about this or he'll be sure to cause a big fuss.
					Last time he went on a personal crusade on behalf of the entire battalion, those pricks over at central started supplying
					the Almayer store-rooms with only the 'Meatloaf' flavored MRE for months. I can still taste the stuff it in my mouth I think..

/datum/fluff_email/almayer/themajor
	title = "The Major?"
	entry_text = {"<html>
					I keep forgetting what the new Major's name is. I got quizzed by one of the jackass staff officers last week about the Major's name,
					and I absolutely spilled my marbles. PFC Mable was watching too, and she probably thinks I've got rocks in my head. I know it's been weeks
					since the new Major took over, but for some reason the name keeps escaping me when it matters. Either the cryo-sleepers are juicing my
					memory capacity or the CO keeps changing their name and not telling anybody. Maybe next jump I'll scrawl it on a sticky note and plaster it
					to the inside of my sleeper pod. I can't be the only one having this problem.

	title = "RE: Tunes"
	entry_text = {"<html>
					Cryosleep is killing me, man. Inside and outside. I mean really, they expect us to sit in that tube for god only knows how long, and when we wake up?
					It's all 'grab a crappy protein bar and grab your gear, you're going to war, Marine!' Bullshit.
					<br>
					<br>
					Anywho, I've been thinking how to make the whole thing more bearable. Tried to take a plush from the bunks with me inside. That dickwad MP took it away from me though, said it was against Operating Procedure. Like I care. Can't do anything fun around here, right?
					My new idea, though, is a Walkman. I'm hoping that I might at least have a sounder sleep with good tunes to go along with it. Now, I know it might sound dumb, but I'm figuratively grasping at straws here, man. Bear with me.
					I don't usually use these things, and frankly that vendor near Medbay has waaay too many cassettes to choose from. Not that I know most songs on them anywho.
					<br>
					<br>
					I saw you with a Walkman from time to time, so... any chances you could recommend a tape to me? Or two, I'm not gonna be picky.
					Just anything to start out with, I just want some nice sounds. Please, I'm gonna go mad if I don't do something about my cryophobia or whatever.
					This might just help with that.

	title = "Prototype Weapon"
	entry_text = {"<html>
					This thing is an absolute blast to use.
					It disintegrated some of the targets down range but you're going to need to work on those cooling coils.
					I used it a few times and I'm seeing the front barrel glow red.
					<br>
					<br>
					Surprisingly accurate too despite being a prototype.
					I know there's like, a couple of prototypes issued to some USCM detachments, but we got to have this shit in production one day.
					<br>
					<br>
					Even as a prototype, it's leagues better than some of the junk we're issued.
					Now, I don't think it's going to replace the old Mark Twos, but it would be a nice addition for some of our grunts that prefer the high-tech approach.
					<br>
					<br>
					You know the ones, all nerdy and gadget loving geeks in the corps. Hell, I can already hear them glossing over this thing in their sleep.
					My report has been sent back to you and I'm really excited to see how this turns out.

	entry_text = {"<html>
					Thanks for sending the report in, we've been mulling over the data you sent over.
					We've updated the design for the prototype which solves most of the problems everyone has encountered.
					This one looks more promising than the last one.
					And as much as everyone wants this done and shippped, I don't think this is going to be issued en masse for a good while.

	entry_text = {"<html>
				Man last mission was an absolute shit show.
				<br>
				The USS Heyst got their shit kicked in with a missile and we got our cargo hold set on fire. And most of our good ammo is gone too!
				Now we're left with the FMJs and the older AP munitions. What's worse is that most of 1st platoon is pretty much out of action.
				Lotta folks are in the sickbay and the rest of us are heading off to cryosleep, well what's left of us. There's not many of the old guard left I'm afraid.
				Until we get reinforced with more bodies, command has given the go ahead to merge 2nd platoon into 1st for the time being.

	entry_text = {"<html>
				Hey, remember last shore leave on LV-179? Man, that was one crazy night. The folks at the colony had setup a rally race with their tractors all stripped of non-essentials.
				LCPL Millard got pretty friendly with the locals and got himself into the competition.
				We all put in a little wager to see if he'd even get close to first place or even survive to the finish line.
				Now most of the boys bet a fair amount against him since he was pretty new to our outfit, yet I've been out on detail with the guy.
				<br>
				<br>
				Millard grew up on one of those shake and bake colonies and used to drive the big daisies around.
				He knew the ins and outs of what made them tick. The few of us who had faith in him reaped everyone else's
				paycheck for the week with Millard finishing first place by a near country mile.

				Has anyone seen Mendoza around? He owes me half of his paycheck from last month's poker game.
				Everyone's payday was a week ago and we're all set to head back to Chinook station.
				Could have sworn I saw him near the cargo elevator yesterday.
				I'll catch him back at base once we've docked because I need that money to pay off my tab at the bar.
