//SUPPLY PACKS
//NOTE: only secure crate types use the access var (and are lockable)
//NOTE: hidden packs only show up when the computer has been hacked.
//ANOTER NOTE: Contraband is obtainable through modified supplycomp circuitboards.
//BIG NOTE: Don't add living things to crates, that's bad, it will break the shuttle.
//NEW NOTE: Do NOT set the price of any crates below 7 points. Doing so allows infinite points.
//We are now moving the price of RO orders to defines, try to respect it.
