//NOTE: only secure crate types use the access var (and are lockable)
//ANOTER NOTE: Contraband is obtainable through modified supplycomp circuitboards.
//BIG NOTE: Don't add living things to crates, that's bad, it will break the shuttle.
//NOTE: Do NOT set the price of any crates below 7 points. Doing so allows infinite points.

// The lists of supply groups and contraband groups have been moved to /obj/structure/machinery/computer/supply/asrs definition as static variables.
