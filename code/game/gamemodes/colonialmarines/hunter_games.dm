/** Hunter Games gamemode
 * Battle royale mode inspired by the hunger games.
 * Players are spawned as contestants with (basically) no rules.
 * They are to fight to the death, there can only be one.
 * Predators will appear to agitate and moderate the games.
 * They want good, brutal fights to determine the strongest prey to hunt themselves.
 *
 * On every few process() we check for how many contestants are left alive, and end the game if a win condition is met.
 * Guns are replaced with melee weapons.
