However, due to a combination of quality issues and being unmaintainable from proprietary parts, the machine often has problems. One such problem is in the chip reader, resulting in the fabricator being unable to detect a bottle directly on it, and such fails to activate, resulting in a person having to stand there and manually hold a bottle at the correct height to fill it."
