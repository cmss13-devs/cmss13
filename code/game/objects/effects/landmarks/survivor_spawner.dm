Unfortunately, right before you came close to a landing zone, a glob of acid hit the ship, damaging one of the engines. Despite all the efforts of the pilot, the ship went straight into nearby mountain. You were hurt pretty badly in the crash. Dumbfounded, you rose up and noticed that one of your limbs is at a weird angle, broken. You looked at other survivors, also limping and trying to fix their broken bones. \red You also notice that sentry turrets on the ramp of your ship beep angrily, it seems their logic circuits got damaged. They will identify you as a foe, but at least they will identify everything as a foe."
