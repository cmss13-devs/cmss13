				<h1>Detective Work</h1>

				Between your bouts of self-narration and drinking whiskey on the rocks, you might get a case or two to solve.<br>
				To have the best chance to solve your case, follow these directions:
				<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Go to the crime scene. </li>
					<li>Take your scanner and scan EVERYTHING (Yes, the doors, the tables, even the dog). </li>
					<li>Once you are reasonably certain you have every scrap of evidence you can use, find all possible entry points and scan them, too. </li>
					<li>Return to your office. </li>
					<li>Using your forensic scanning computer, scan your scanner to upload all of your evidence into the database.</li>
					<li>Browse through the resulting dossiers, looking for the one that either has the most complete set of prints, or the most suspicious items handled. </li>
					<li>If you have 80% or more of the print (The print is displayed), go to step 10, otherwise continue to step 8.</li>
					<li>Look for clues from the suit fibres you found on your perpetrator, and go about looking for more evidence with this new information, scanning as you go. </li>
					<li>Try to get a fingerprint card of your perpetrator, as if used in the computer, the prints will be completed on their dossier.</li>
					<li>Assuming you have enough of a print to see it, grab the biggest complete piece of the print and search the security records for it. </li>
					<li>Since you now have both your dossier and the name of the person, print both out as evidence and get security to nab your baddie.</li>
					<li>Give yourself a pat on the back and a bottle of the ship's finest vodka, you did it!</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
				It really is that easy! Good luck!

				<h1>Nuclear Explosives 101</h1>
				Hello and thank you for choosing the CLF for your nuclear information needs. Today's crash course will deal with the operation of a Fusion Class Weyland-Yutani made Nuclear Device.<br><br>

				First and foremost, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING UNTIL THE BOMB IS IN PLACE. Pressing any button on the compacted bomb will cause it to extend and bolt itself into place. If this is done, to unbolt it, one must completely log in, which at this time may not be possible.<br>

				<h2>To make the nuclear device functional</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Place the nuclear device in the designated detonation zone.</li>
					<li>Extend and anchor the nuclear device from its interface.</li>
					<li>Insert the nuclear authorisation disk into the slot.</li>
					<li>Type the numeric authorisation code into the keypad. This should have been provided.<br>
					<b>Note</b>: If you make a mistake, press R to reset the device.
					<li>Press the E button to log on to the device.</li>
				</ul><br>

				You now have activated the device. To deactivate the buttons at anytime, for example when you've already prepped the bomb for detonation, remove the authentication disk OR press R on the keypad.<br><br>
				Now the bomb CAN ONLY be detonated using the timer. Manual detonation is not an option. Toggle off the SAFETY.<br>
				<b>Note</b>: You wouldn't believe how many Syndicate Operatives with doctorates have forgotten this step.<br><br>

				So use the - - and + + to set a detonation time between 5 seconds and 10 minutes. Then press the timer toggle button to start the countdown. Now remove the authentication disk so that the buttons deactivate.<br>
				<b>Note</b>: THE BOMB IS STILL SET AND WILL DETONATE<br><br>

				Now before you remove the disk, if you need to move the bomb, you can toggle off the anchor, move it, and re-anchor.<br><br>

				Remember the order:<br>
				<b>Disk, Code, Safety, Timer, Disk, RUN!</b><br><br>
				Intelligence Analysts believe that normal Weyland-Yutani procedure is for the Commanding Officer, or Captain, to secure the nuclear authentication disk.<br><br>

				Good luck!

				<h1><a name="Foreword"><U><B>HOW TO NOT SUCK QUITE SO HARD AT ATMOSPHERICS</B></U></a></h1><BR>
				<I>Or: What the fuck does a "passive gate" do?</I><BR><BR>

				Alright. It has come to my attention that a variety of people are unsure of what a "pipe" is and what it does.
				Apparently, there is an unnatural fear of these arcane devices and their "gases." Spooky, spooky. So,
				this will tell you what every device constructable by an ordinary pipe dispenser within atmospherics actually does.
				You are not going to learn what to do with them to be the super best person ever, or how to play guitar with passive gates,
				or something like that. Just what stuff does.<BR><BR>


				<h1><a name="Basic"><B>Basic Pipes</B></a></h1>
				<I>The boring ones.</I><BR>
				Most ordinary pipes are pretty straightforward. They hold gas. If gas is moving in a direction for some reason, gas will flow in that direction.
				That's about it. Even so, here's all of your wonderful pipe options.<BR>

				<ul>
				<li><b>Straight pipes:</b> They're pipes. One-meter sections. Straight line. Pretty simple. Just about every pipe and device is based around this
				standard one-meter size, so most things will take up as much space as one of these.</li>
				<li><b>Bent pipes:</b> Pipes with a 90 degree bend at the half-meter mark. My goodness.</li>
				<li><b>Pipe manifolds:</b> Pipes that are essentially a "T" shape, allowing you to connect three things at one point.</li>
				<li><b>4-way manifold:</b> A four-way junction.</li>
				<li><b>Pipe cap:</b> Caps off the end of a pipe. Open ends don't actually vent air, because of the way the pipes are assembled, so, uh, use them to decorate your house or something.</li>
				<li><b>Manual valve:</b> A valve that will block off airflow when turned. Can't be used by the AI or cyborgs, because they don't have hands.</li>
				<li><b>Manual T-valve:</b> Like a manual valve, but at the center of a manifold instead of a straight pipe.</li><BR><BR>
				</ul>

				<h1><a name="Insulated"><B>Insulated Pipes</B></a></h1>
				<li><I>Bent pipes:</I> Pipes with a 90 degree bend at the half-meter mark. My goodness.</li>
				<li><I>Pipe manifolds:</I> Pipes that are essentially a "T" shape, allowing you to connect three things at one point.</li>
				<li><I>4-way manifold:</I> A four-way junction.</li>
				<li><I>Pipe cap:</I> Caps off the end of a pipe. Open ends don't actually vent air, because of the way the pipes are assembled, so, uh. Use them to decorate your house or something.</li>
				<li><I>Manual Valve:</I> A valve that will block off airflow when turned. Can't be used by the AI or cyborgs, because they don't have hands.</li>
				<li><I>Manual T-Valve:</I> Like a manual valve, but at the center of a manifold instead of a straight pipe.</li><BR><BR>

				<h1><a name="Insulated"><B>Insulated Pipes</B></a></h1><BR>
				<I>Special Public Service Announcement.</I><BR>
				Our regular pipes are already insulated. These are completely worthless. Punch anyone who uses them.<BR><BR>

				<h1><a name="Devices"><B>Devices: </B></a></h1>
				<I>They actually do something.</I><BR>
				This is usually where people get frightened, afraid, and start calling on their gods and/or cowering in fear. Yes, I can see you doing that right now.
				Stop it. It's unbecoming. Most of these are fairly straightforward.<BR>

				<ul>
				<li><b>Gas pump:</b> Take a wild guess. It moves gas in the direction it's pointing (marked by the red line on one end). It moves it based on pressure, the maximum output being 4500 kPa (kilopascals).
				Ordinary atmospheric pressure, for comparison, is 101.3 kPa, and the minimum pressure of room-temperature pure oxygen needed to not suffocate in a matter of minutes is 16 kPa
				(though 18 kPa is preferred using internals, for various reasons).</li>
				<li><b>Volume pump:</b> This pump goes based on volume, instead of pressure, and the possible maximum pressure it can create in the pipe on the receiving end is double the gas pump because of this,
				clocking in at an incredible 9000 kPa. If a pipe with this is destroyed or damaged, and this pressure of gas escapes, it can be incredibly dangerous depending on the size of the pipe filled.
				Don't hook this to the distribution loop, or you will make babies cry and the Chief Engineer brutally beat you.</li>
				<li><b>Passive gate:</b> This is essentially a cap on the pressure of gas allowed to flow in a specific direction.
				When turned on, instead of actively pumping gas, it measures the pressure flowing through it, and whatever pressure you set is the maximum: it'll cap after that.
				In addition, it only lets gas flow one way. The direction the gas flows is opposite the red handle on it, which is confusing to people used to the red stripe on pumps pointing the way.</li>
				<li><b>Unary vent:</b> The basic vent used in rooms. It pumps gas into the room, but can't suck it back out. Controlled by the room's air alarm system.</li>
				<li><b>Scrubber:</b> The other half of room equipment. Filters air, and can suck it in entirely in what's called a "panic siphon." Activating a panic siphon without very good reason will kill someone. Don't do it.</li>
				<li><b>Meter:</b> A little box with some gauges and numbers. Fasten it to any pipe or manifold and it'll read you the pressure in it. Very useful.</li>
				<li><b>Gas mixer:</b> Two sides are input, one side is output. Mixes the gases pumped into it at the ratio defined. The side perpendicular to the other two is "node 2," for reference.
				Can output this gas at pressures from 0-4500 kPa.</li>
				<li><b>Gas filter:</b> Essentially the opposite of a gas mixer. One side is input. The other two sides are output. One gas type will be filtered into the perpendicular output pipe,
				the rest will continue out the other side. Can also output from 0-4500 kPa.</li>
				</ul>

				<h1><a name="HES"><B>Heat Exchange Systems</B></a></h1>
				<I>Will not set you on fire.</I><BR>
				These systems are used to only transfer heat between two pipes. They will not move gases or any other element, but will equalize the temperature (eventually). Note that because of how gases work (remember: pv=nRt),
				a higher temperature will raise pressure, and a lower one will lower temperature.<BR>

				<li><I>Pipe:</I> This is a pipe that will exchange heat with the surrounding atmosphere. Place in fire for superheating. Place in space for supercooling.</li>
				<li><I>Bent pipe:</I> Take a wild guess.</li>
				<li><I>Junction:</I> The point where you connect your normal pipes to heat exchange pipes. Not necessary for heat exchangers, but necessary for H/E pipes/bent pipes.</li>
				<li><I>Heat exchanger:</I> These funky-looking bits attach to an open pipe end. Put another heat exchanger directly across from it, and you can transfer heat across two pipes without having to have the gases touch.
				This normally shouldn't exchange with the ambient air, despite being totally exposed. Just don't ask questions...</li><BR>

				That's about it for pipes. Go forth, armed with this knowledge, and try not to break, burn down, or kill anything. Please.

				EVA gear. Wonderful to use. It's useful for mining, engineering, and occasionally just surviving, if things are that bad. Most people have EVA training,
				but apparently there are some on a space station who don't. This guide should give you a basic idea of how to use this gear, safely. It's split into two sections:
				Civilian suits and hardsuits.<BR><BR>

				<h2><a name="Civilian">Civilian Suits</a></h2>
				<I>The bulkiest things this side of Alpha Centauri</I><BR>
				These suits are the grey ones that are stored in EVA. They're the more simple to get on, but are also a lot bulkier, and provide less protection from environmental hazards such as radiation or physical impact.
				As Medical, Engineering, Security, and Mining all have hardsuits of their own, these don't see much use, but knowing how to put them on is quite useful anyways.<BR><BR>

				First, take the suit. It should be in three pieces: A top, a bottom, and a helmet. Put the bottom on first, shoes and the like will fit in it. If you have magnetic boots, however,
				put them on on top of the suit's feet. Next, get the top on, as you would a shirt. It can be somewhat awkward putting these pieces on, due to the makeup of the suit,
				but to an extent they will adjust to you. You can then find the snaps and seals around the waist, where the two pieces meet. Fasten these, and double-check their tightness.
				The red indicators around the waist of the lower half will turn green when this is done correctly. Next, put on whatever breathing apparatus you're using, be it a gas mask or a breath mask. Make sure the oxygen tube is fastened into it.
				Put on the helmet now, straightforward, and make sure the tube goes into the small opening specifically for internals. Again, fasten seals around the neck, a small indicator light in the inside of the helmet should go from red to off when all is fastened.
				There is a small slot on the side of the suit where an emergency oxygen tank or extended emergency oxygen tank will fit,
				but it is recommended to have a full-sized tank on your back for EVA.<BR><BR>

				<h2><a name="Hardsuit">Hardsuits</a></h2>
				<I>Heavy, uncomfortable, still the best option.</I><BR>
				These suits come in Engineering, Mining, and the Armory. There's also a couple Medical Hardsuits in EVA. These provide a lot more protection than the standard suits.<BR><BR>

				Similarly to the other suits, these are split into three parts. Fastening the pant and top are mostly the same as the other spacesuits, with the exception that these are a bit heavier,
				though not as bulky. The helmet goes on differently, with the air tube feeding into the suit and out a hole near the left shoulder, while the helmet goes on turned ninety degrees counter-clockwise,
				and then is screwed in for one and a quarter full rotations clockwise, leaving the faceplate directly in front of you. There is a small button on the right side of the helmet that activates the helmet light.
				The tanks that fasten onto the side slot are emergency tanks, as well as full-sized oxygen tanks, leaving your back free for a backpack or satchel.<BR><BR>

				<h2><a name="Final">Final Checks</a></h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Are all seals fastened correctly?</li>
					<li>Do you either have shoes on under the suit, or magnetic boots on over it?</li>
					<li>Do you have a mask on and internals on the suit or your back?</li>
					<li>Do you have a way to communicate with the station in case something goes wrong?</li>
					<li>Do you have a second person watching if this is a training session?</li><BR>
				</ul>

				If you don't have any further issues, go out and do whatever is necessary.

				<h1>Raising Bees</h1>

				Bees are loving but fickle creatures. Don't mess with their hive and stay away from any clusters of them, and you'll avoid their ire.
				Sometimes, you'll need to dig around in there for those delicious sweeties though - in that case make sure you wear sealed protection gear
				and carry an extinguisher or smoker with you - any bees chasing you, once calmed down, can thusly be netted and returned safely to the hive.<br.
				<br>
				BeezEez is a cure-all panacea for them, but use it too much and the hive may grow to apocalyptic proportions. Other than that, bees are excellent pets
				for all the family and are excellent caretakers of one's garden: having a hive or two around will aid in the longevity and growth rate of plants,
				and aid them in fighting off poisons and disease.

				<h1>Guide to the USCM Orbital Bombardment System</h1>

				<h2>Step by step instructions:</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Load a warhead in the Orbital Cannon Tray (Powerloader required).</li>
					<li>Load the required amount of solid fuel in the Orbital Cannon Tray <b>(See Orbital Cannon Console)</b>.</li>
					<li>Open the Orbital Cannon Console's interface.</li>
					<li>Load the Tray into the Cannon.</li>
					<li>Chamber the Tray's content into the cannon barrel. <b>(can't be undone!)</b></li>
					<li>The CIC staff can now fire the Orbital Cannon from any overwatch console.</li>
					<li>After firing, unload the Tray from the Orbital Cannon.</li>
					<li>Inspect the Tray to make sure it is empty and operational.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Troubleshooting:</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>If you've loaded a tray with an incorrect payload, you can still unload the tray's payload as long as it hasn't been chambered.</li>
					<li>If an incorrect payload is chambered, it can only be removed by firing it.</li>
					<li>If the Orbital Cannon Console has no power, check the Weapon Control Room's APC.</li>
					<li>If the Orbital Cannon Console is broken, contact USCM HQ for a replacement.</li>
					<li>In case of direct damage to the Orbital Cannon itself, do not attempt to use or repair the cannon.</li>
					<li>In case of hull breach or fire, make sure to remove the Cannon's payload and move it to a safe location.</li>
					<li>If the Orbital Tray jams, apply lubricant to the  conveyor belt.</li>
					<li>If a cable of the Orbital Cannon System is severed, contact USCM HQ for a replacement.</li>
					<li>If Cannon's cable connector breaks, turn off the Orbital Cannon Console and contact USCM HQ for a replacement.</li>
				</ul>
