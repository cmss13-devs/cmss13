/*

Plants, trees, etc. If you want to create a plant that can have variations, make sure the .dmi file
has all of the variations with the same prefix and different numbers

Example:
	/obj/structure/flora/plant
		icon_tag = "plant"
		variations = "5"

	when this plant is created, it'll pick one of the five icon states in the dmi file, provided that you have plant_1, plant_3, etc

If you want to make plant cuttable, change it's cut_level var

PLANT_NO_CUT = 1 = Can't be cut down
PLANT_CUT_KNIFE = 2 = Needs at least a bootknife to be cut down
PLANT_CUT_MACHETE = 3 = Needs at least a machete to be cut down
