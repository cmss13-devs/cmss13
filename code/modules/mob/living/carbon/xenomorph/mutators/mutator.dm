	// HOW TO ADD A NEW MUTATOR
	// Step 0: Write an action(s)
	//			  the "handler" procs go in the appropriate caste's subfolder under the "ABILITIES" file.
	// 			  the actual ACTION procs go in the appropriate caste's subfolder under the "POWERS" file.
	// 			  Any constants you need to access for your strain should be in the behavior holder and
	//			  accessed using a cast to it using the mutator_type variable as defined below. (Or using an istype of the behavior holder)
	//		      vars that absolutely must be held on the xenos themselves can be added to the Xenomorph class itself.
	//            Be sure to follow the spec in xeno_action.dm as far as setting up xeno_cooldown is concerned.
	//
	// Step 1: Write the Behavior Delegate datum IF NECESSARY
	//            the "behavior holder" datum defines all unique behavior and state for each xeno/strain. It works by embedding a number of 'hooks'
	// 			  for example, if you want to store bonus damage and apply it on slashes, behavior delegates are the way to do it.
	//            in common procs that call back to Xeno features. See other behavior delegates for examples. Afterward, set the behavior_delegate_type
	// 			  var on the strain datum to indicate which behavior holder to apply to your strain.
	//
	// Step 1: Copy/paste another datum definiton and edit it for your strain
	// 		  	make sure to populate each of the variables listed above (at least as much as other strains)
	//
	// Step 2: Write the apply_mutator proc.
	//			FIRST:   populate mutator_actions_to_add and mutator_actions_to_remove according to that documentation.
	//			THEN:    write the body of the apply_mutator method according to your speficiations
	// 			THEN:    call mutator_update_actions on your xeno
	//					 call recalculate actions on your mutator set (this should be auto populated)
	//                   You should probably also call recalculate_everything() on the host Xeno to make sure you don't end up with any
	//  				 strange transient values.
	//          THEN:    Set the mutation_type var on the host xeno to "name" the strain.
	//          FINALLY: Call apply_behavior_holder() to add the behavior datum to the new Xeno.
	//
	//	You're done!
