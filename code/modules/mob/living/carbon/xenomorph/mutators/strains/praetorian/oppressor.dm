You also gain a powerful punch that reduces your other abilities' cooldowns, pierces through armor, and does double damage in addition to rooting slowed targets. You can also knock talls back and slow them with your new Tail Lash and quickly grab a tall, slow it, and pull it towards you with your unique Tail Stab."
