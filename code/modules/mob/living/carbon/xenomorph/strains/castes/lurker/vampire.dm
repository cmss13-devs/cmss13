Rush on your opponent to disorient them and Flurry to unleash a forward cleave that can hit and slow three talls and heal you for every tall you hit. Use your special AoE Tail Jab to knock talls away, doing more damage with direct hits and even more damage and a stun if they smack into walls. Finally, execute unconscious talls with a headbite that bypasses armor and heals you for a grand amount of health."
