	  *
	  * Base surgery datum and procs. There is an important distinction between surgery datums and surgery steps.
	  * The surgery is a separate instance for each individual operation; the steps are shared globally.
	  * datum/surgery and datum/surgery_step are intertwined. The surgery calls the step which modifies the surgery.
	  * Defines are in __DEFINES/human.dm and __DEFINES/surgery.dm.
