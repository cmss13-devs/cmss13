### MOB MOVEMENT ###

## We suggest editing these variabled in-game to find a good speed for your server. To do this you must be a high level admin. Open the 'debug' tab ingame. Select "Debug Controller" and then, in the popup, select "Configuration". These variables should have the same name.

## These values get directly added to values and totals in-game. To speed things up make the number negative, to slow things down, make the number positive.


## These modify the run/walk speed of all mobs before the mob-specific modifiers are applied.
RUN_SPEED 1
WALK_SPEED 1
