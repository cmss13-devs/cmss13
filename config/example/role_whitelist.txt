# +Y_aut j a El_DER will be converted into yautjaelder.
# You may add any of the possible roles below, using different names as indicated.
# Adding two or more of the same role will not matter.

# Elder means Clan Leader for Yautja
# SEA flag is unnecessary as it is given though the various staff/mentor ranks
