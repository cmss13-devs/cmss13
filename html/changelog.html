				<li class="rscadd">Added the IMP Logistics satchel. Its a big satchel backpack hybrid (It is the IO bag, don't question it). It can be found in the utilities section of squad vendors.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the smartgunner drum belt. It can hold 6 ammo drums, but doesn't come with a sidearm. It starts with the same amount of drums as the now renamed smartgunner sidearm belt.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The new machete pouch has been added as standard equipment for the smartgunner.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Add the new IMP logistics backpack to req alongside all the other speciality bags and backpacks.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added pre-filled medical pouchs (aforementioned splints and pill variants) to req alongside the empty variants.</li>
				<li class="spellcheck">Added the MK2 designation to M41A ammunition in vendors that also have M41A MK1 magazines.</li>
				<li class="spellcheck">Changed 'barrel' to 'muzzle' in attachment vendors.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the M10 technician helmet to the surplus uniform vendor and req.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added skill-less variants of kelotane, bicardine, and emergency auto injectors.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Changed medium metal stacks to contain 30 metal from 25.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the 'med-small-stack' of metal which contains 20 sheets, and the 'med-large-stack' which contains 40 sheets for use by mappers. The same has been done for plasteel.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Pistol magazine pouches shouldn't be able to hold shotgun shells anymore.</li>
				<li class="spellcheck">Changed the description for the M12 dust helmet and the M11 helmet (previously RTO and SL helmets).</li>
				<li class="spellcheck">Removed the X from the XM4 items used by the RTO.</li>
				<li class="spellcheck">Changed the description of the 88 Mod 4 to better reflect its place in the game's canon.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Rain covers, helmet netting, gun lube, USCM flair, and M5 integrated gasmasks to the surplus squad uniform vendors.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Replaced the old 'pro case' icons (the ones marine kits used).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added radio keys for JTAC, Tactics, Engineering, and Supply as point buys to squad vendors.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added JTAC, Engineering, and Powerloader pamphlets to squad vendors (where there wasn't overlap with the role's existing skills).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added HIRR baton slugs from the Technical Manual. They slow aliens and enemy humans for 2 seconds on hit. They deal 45 damage with no AP. Large xenos are slowed for 3.5 seconds on hit. Small xenos and enemy faction human mobs are knocked down for 0.3 seconds. Synthetics and Hunters are slowed for 1 second.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the M79 grenade launcher, it comes loaded with baton slugs by default. It has IFF and can fire any (marine) grenade type.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the star shell grenade, it explodes into burning phosphorus that is brighter than standard flares, but doesn't last as long. They can ignite mobs, but the accuracy is terribly low. It must be fired from a launcher in order to function.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the hornet grenade, it explodes into small .22lr pellets just like the real world 40mm hornet shell. Think of it like a airburst grenade but with weaker buckshot. Explodes into a 15 degree cone, dealing 45 damage per bullet with 25 AP. It must be fired from a launcher in order to function.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Updated the van bandolier belt sprites.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Nerfed the HPDP grenade. It now deals 40 damage per tick from 50. Aliens and Hunters take 25% reduced damage in Phosphorus Smoke (30 per tick). Firestacks remain at 5 added per tick. Keep in mind phosphorus smoke deals TRUE BURN DAMAGE, in that it ignores fire resistance and armor, which is why its so nasty to Hunters.</li>
				<li class="experiment">HPDP grenades on the Almayer and those available to marines release a weaker version of WP smoke compared to those employed by MARSOC. They deal 30 damage per tick, and Aliens and Hunters take 50% reduced damage from this variant (15 per tick). Firestacks remain at 5 added per tick.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added knife webbing to req. It is a webbing vest that can hold 5 knives.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The new first-aid pouch injectors can be refilled at nanomeds, and wey-meds. Left click the used injector onto a powered and applicable device.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Resprited the bronze heart medal.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added gun oil, helmet netting, helmet rain covers, USCM flair, and the M5 integrated gasmask to squad uniform supply vendors.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the 88 Mod 4 burst stock, enabling burst fire and massively buffing the weapon into a primary. While attached, the weapon cannot fit into a holster and must be worn on the armor. Currently admin spawn only.</li>
