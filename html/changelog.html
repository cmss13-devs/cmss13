			<h3 class="author">TheDonkified updated:</h3>

				<li class="bugfix">Throwing items at resin structures should damage them now.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">ThePiachu updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Replaced syringe pouches with medkit pouches for WO doctors.</li>
				<li class="tweak">WO requisition thingies should give proper smartgun ammo instead of just powerpacks.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">WO XO uniform should not be honked anymore.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">WO tactical binoculars should have proper sprites now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Replaced WO Smartgunner's SMG ammo pouch with a firstaid pouch.</li>
				<li class="tweak">WO Xeno waves have been tweaked and shouldn't delay the round.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">WO ERT should spawn properly on wave 7.</li>
				<li class="tweak">WO Xenos will stay on for a second or two after death to give a little bit of a visual feedback of being dead before being deleted.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">WO Xeno final waves will spawn properly now (and will continue spawning until -morale- death improves).</li>
				<li class="tweak">WO Synths get their cool smartpack now.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">WO map has been tweaked a bit - there is a second bluespace beaker in chemistry, CO's quarters feature their tablet and the M46C gun, there are a handful of cryopods in the sleeping bunks, there are some operating tables in Triage, as well as some synth recharge stations.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Simplified Tcomms logic - it won't have to bounce through tcomm structures to get to your ears, hopefully meaning we'll have less chat overhead. This also means Tcomms won't be tied to Almayer (important for WO) - if you have a relay tower on the surface you can communicate there, even if Almayer is down.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Deleted unused communication logic from the various Tcomm machines.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">WO now uses the new Tcomms relay tower.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Souto Man's icon sprites, gun and vehicle.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now drag and drop yourself into recharge stations.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added some gear presets for Xeno Cultists - basic Cultist dressed in a creepy robe, Patriarch dressed in a xeno outfit, and the Midwife - a gen 1 synth in a xeno outfit with medical gear. These don't appear in normal rounds and are there just for admin events.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Predalien sprites not working.</li>
				<li class="tweak">All basic suits can now fit some basic equipment into their HUD slot - a flashlight, crowbar, radio, health analyser, oxygen tank and a pen. Armour is unchanged and some suits can carry different things on top of the basic equipment. This is to make a bigger variety of clothing useful.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Predator glaive should now properly apply Interference on xenos.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Turned some `twohanded` weapon function paths absolute.</li>
				<li class="tweak">SEAs now have access to MP comms by default.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Added a new access class for civilians - civilian command.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">CORSAT access has been tweaked a bit - it won't require Corporate access, but use civilian command access.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Updated various survivor access to use some newly added access classes.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">CORSAT now has some Powerloader pamphlets around the Powerloader bays for those ungas that want to go Ripley on Queen's thorax.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Synth defibbing timer has been extended to give ghosts more time to get back into their body.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Defib healing amount has been made flat to that of a doctor skill.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Give Synth skill speed boost to some minor timers around stripping and putting items back onto people, tcomms assembly and repair, removing splints.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">TobiNerd updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="experiment">Reworked the chemical property system backend. All chemicals are now processed using properties, not just research chems.

				<li class="rscadd">Added the properties hemositic, thermostabilizing, focusing, cardiostabilizing, aiding, oxygenating, anticarcinogenic and ciphering.

				<li class="rscadd">Also added the property electrogenetic, a common positive type.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Properties now have categories in addition to type and rarity, these are medicine, toxicant, stimulant, reactant, irritant, metabolite, and anomalous.</li>

				<li class="tweak">The synthesis simulator now displays the property type.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The boosting property now only affects properties that have an effect inside the body.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Many chemicals have received slightly different overdose effects as these are tied to the properties.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Overdosing on a painkiller now gives you +50% painkilling, plus the additional nasty overdose stuff.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Synthesis targeting a rare property on relation mode now cost 3 times as much. Changing anomalous properties costs 10 times as much.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Alkysine is no longer a painkiller.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Halved the gain from the musclestimulating property per level.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Having only positive properties in a chemical now increase all Synthesis Simulator operation costs by 1.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some inconsistency in how properties were combining.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">CL setting clearance to max no longer decrease it when clearance has been bought #12239.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed rare chemical properties spawning at the same rate as uncommon properties.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed epinephrine (Electrogenetic) not working.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added a garbage collector to the game. It's basically a background process that will periodically delete junk items from the game to hopefully lower late game lag. The items removed shouldn't affect the gameplay - burnt out flares, empty boxes, spent casings, literal garbage, etc. It won't remove items from your inventory in case you want to hold onto something specifically, and it won't instantly delete newly created garbage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added boxes of MREs and flares, so that Requisitions won't have to send them down in backpacks. Sprites by Triiodine.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed Requisitions crates to use those boxes instead of the loose items.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed Large Supply Crates to do the same (you can find one in Requisitions!).</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed weapon-specific skills (pistols, shotguns, SMGs, etc.) - they were too redundant.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed the Survival skill - it was only used to gate one recipe - molotov cocktail. Now everyone can make those! Just use paper on a bottle of something flammable.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Squished a lot of skill levels down to just a handful. They most often fall under "untrained / basic training (mini-kits) / trained (combat engis, combat medics, OTs, doctors, etc.)". Cut down on snowflake levels for singular roles, like Researchers being worse at surgery, or CEs being better at powerloader.</li>
				<li class="tweak">POs' Powerloader skill has been buffed. The only people with a mid-range powerloader skill are planned to be PFCs after reading a special pamphlet (not in a kit form, but found on colonies around powerloaders).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Some timers have been rebalanced based on the skill changes (like surgery).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Dual-wielding SMGs now has a higher scatter than before (due to removing snowflake SMG skill check).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Shipside Synths will have a new role to play in this new skill system. They will be more efficient at tasks with timers than even the specialised roles. This will mean they can prop up an entire department by themselves, so it will be up to the Command to apply them to the right place. Survivor Synthetics are not as well trained - they are only as good as a single trained individual, but still have the variety of skills to apply themselves anywhere.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Company has recently launched a colony diversity initiative! Not only will the Weston-Yamada colonies not be staffed by clones, they will have actual names and distinct features!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed the corpse spawner system to use Select Equipment system for loading gear, generating names, appearances, etc. This means the generated colonists will appear more varied.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The new USCM protocols have established that walking is now prohibited. All personel must either run or stand still, no inbetween! This extends to every person and creature in the area of operation, civilian or extraterrestrial. (Removed walk intent, it wasn't used anyway, now you will always be running and now have to worry about fat fingering walking intent and dying because of it).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Made WO compile again.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Motion detectors should properly disable themselves when a mob dies, gets hugged, gets buckled into a nest, etc.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Retrieve corpses objectives should display how many points they earn you, not only their completion percentage.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed some unused infrared sight from xenos (we don't use it anyway, it's a whole other BYOND feature).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some null error around holsters.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Dead people's headsets disable themselves automatically. This is for performance reasons. The radios don't disable themselves when you get hugged or nested, so you can preserve that gameplay. To re-enable the headset, just open its menu, it will turn itself on automatically. Hopefully this will improve late-game performance, not having to send messages to 100+ corpses...</li>

				<li class="tweak">All Operating Tables start with an anesthetic tank by default. This should make sure all OTs on all maps are useful for field surgery.</li>

This has already been touted as a great victory for WY research staff that have been dreaming of toss-based research paper sorting for years.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">To go along with the new aerodynamic paper, Weston-Yamata has released a line of corporate-exclusive clicky pens, with stylish black, blue and red ink colour variants. Now the CLs will be able to engage with the old traditions of clicking their pens idilly during boring meetings.</li>

It will be calculated as a ratio of total points gathered vs what you need to unlock the next level (and counting upwards). This means for example once you reach 100% DEFCON 5 you will be dropped to 50% DEFCON 4. This should give everyone a better estimate of how much work is still to be done.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Objectives now have a guaranteed minimal amount of clues generated. Folders and Disks have two, safes have four, experimental items have eight.
