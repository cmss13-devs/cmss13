			<h3 class="author">Atebite updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="experiment">Added a round recorder that tracks player movements and other basic information throughout the round.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Awan updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">You can eat food with the z key now. (If you enabled hotkey mode.)</li>
				<li class="tweak">Using Thwei on humans is fixed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Fax machines have department tags now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Brig has a crew monitor</li>
				<li class="tweak">SEA has a fax machine now.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Awantje updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">removes hpc damage</li>
				<li class="tweak">Lets hpc be targeted instead of being max range always</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Neth updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Added new ability to Shaman Carrier "Remember Pain(300)". This lets you remember amount of xenos near you (non-shaman, expends egg). When you use any other ability, if amount of xenos around you is less than amount you remembered, you will cast your next ability at remembered power and reset the remembered count.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">ThePiachu updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">1st generation synths have been sped up to their later gen counterparts.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Synth self-repair has been sped up.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed DEFCON trigger levels to absolute numbers, rather than percentages. This means you shouldn't see DEFCON percentages go down unless you are really sabotaging yourself. This should also make maps with a lot of civilian corpses less of a grind.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Survivors are worth less intel points now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Xeno containment and corpses are worth different amount of points based on their tier. T1 is worth less than before, T3 is worth more, etc.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Intel scanner now points out data terminals. This will help you locate them in unfamiliar maps.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a new skill to the game - Reading and Comprehension. It's a skill that speeds up processing intel. IOs and all other officers have this skill at an advanced level, cutting down their intel processing time by 25%. There is also an expert level of this skill (which will be available to IOs at a later date once vendor changes come in) to cut down the processing time by 50%.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Mini Intel kits come with a basic reading pamphlet to bring the reader to the level of an IO.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Borg recharge stations now repair synths and borgs.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added objective landmarks to Trijent Dam.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tweaked Solaris Ridge's objective landmarks.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added objective landmarks to Sorokyne Strata.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Upped the DEFCON level requirements for LV.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When fultoned objects drop to the ground they create a new objective - retrieve lost fulton. It is worth zero points, but it's a useful way for IOs to track lost intel crates.</li>
				<li class="tweak">When the nuclear bomb is turned off, its timer resets to full - Marines have to commit to detonating it and not hold the enemies hostage at 30 seconds pause.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a command lockout to the bomb. If engaged by the command staff (anyone with Bridge access), it makes it so only command staff can toggle safety and toggle the timer. This is to limit potential griefing with the bomb timer.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Egg Morpher can now store 12 huggers. Each corpse still produces 6 huggers.</li>
				<li class="tweak">When Egg Morpher is destroyed it spawns some of its huggers around itself, like a dying Carrier.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Survivor synthetic now has access to Research by default (since they are WY property, and to help on CORSAT access)</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reading pamphlets are not a bit less patronising.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Paper objectives now get a small pixel offset.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Progress Reports and Technical Manuals are now a bit faster to read, especially the latter.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some runtime errors around smartpacks, defibs, xeno hives, etc.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed MPs not being able to use some MP lockers.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Intel scanners can now detect detatched synth heads.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Crypod logs now list an area name rather than floor name.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Solaris Ridge DEFCON level triggers have been made harder to complete.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced the amount of unnecessary processing for idle airlocks, disposal units and computers. This should hopefully have some positive effect on lag, especially on large station maps.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed double inits of carpets, some other floors and paralysis pen.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Hopefully fixed some other null runtime error.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Triiodine's sprite to the reading pamphlet.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Vials get a small pixel offset.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">TobiNerd updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Research can now transmit chemical data to the central WY database. This will make that chem exist in the following round, although with a new recipe, name and clearance level. The new clearance level and transmisison cost is based off the properties of the chem, whereas negative and neutral properties lower the cost.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The CL can now print research grants containing 4 research credits for 30 briefcase points.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The CL can now print a chemical report for a new unique chemical at the cost of 50 briefcase points. The level of this chemical will be equal to the current clearance level of the research department.</li>

				<li class="tweak">The CMO now spawns with a level 2 chemical report in their labcoat.</li>
				<li class="tweak">All papers can now be added to the research database by clicking a research terminal with the paper. This means you can make your own hand-written publications!</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now read papers from the research database without printing them.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Doubled the strength of the painkilling chemical property. Standard painkillers have had their property levels adjusted accordingly.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cryometabolizing now acts as a booster to other properties for half its own level. The levels of other properties in cryoxadone and clonexadone have been lowered to represent the same healing result with the boost. #11636 by Watermelon914.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Research now starts with 2 credits instead of 1.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added a filing cabinet to the CMO office.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed hyposprays that spawn empty not having a vial inside.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You can no longer target chems with no recipe in the synthesis simulator, such as elementary particles.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed chem transmitted to the next round not loading properties correctly.</li>

			<h3 class="author">Neth updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Removed default round start buff to upgrade and evolution for xenos</li>
				<li class="tweak">Evolution and Upgrade speed is now tied to number of xenos (more xenos, less upgrade), marines (more marines, more upgrade) and time (more time, more upgrade). To top it off, it is all finally related to number of Larva. If you have no larva, this bonus is not applied. The more larva you have, the proportionally more upgrade speed you will have. These effects are active only when queen is in ovipositor or first few minutes of the round.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Example, 100 marines, 10 xenos and 30 larva. Boost is 6.5x for the first ten minutes then it goes to 13x if NO XENOS JOIN after 40 minutes. If xenos keep joining as larva numbers lower, it will taper down, it will be about 1x when there are no larva left.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Returned basic increase for first 30 minutes for upgrade level and evolution. Now it's a maximum of two systems, whatever is bigger will be applied.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Xenos can now see their Evilution Boost level</li>
				<li class="tweak">Humans that are running AND without suit armor (that is actually an armor and not a santa suit) can now be neuroed in one hit. This applies to all neuro shots.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added a delivery chute in the OT workshop and research lobby that transports items to the requisitions.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Automated Chemical Integrated Delivery harness (A.C.I.D.). This special vest is will progressively scan its wearer for specific health issues and injecting its medicine when the conditions are met. Additionally it will also report the overall health to the wearer. Inspiration from #8988 by Alardun.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The A.C.I.D. harness inject conditions can be configured by using a multitool/security access tuner on the vest.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Research will start with two A.C.I.D. harnesses. More can be assembled by using a wirecutter on a webbing vest containing one healthanalyzer, radio, cable coil, hypospray and a battery.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a new type of randomly spawned research note, research grants. Scanning these at the research data terminal will reward research credits.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the chemical properties excreting, hypometabolizing, hypermetabolizing, sedative. Inspiration from #8970 by Watermelon914.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added 10 rare chemical properties. One rare property will now spawn in clearance level 3 and 4 chemicals at a 30% and 100% rate respectively, to make them extra special. Inspiration from #8914 by Watermelon914.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Hyposprays now have an internal vial that it uses as a magazine. This can be ejected after unlocking the hypospray with a screwdriver. You can still fill the hypospray directly if it has a vial in it, which will technically just transfer to the vial instead.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now add autoinjectors to vial boxes. The research centrifuge can now be used to fill autoinjectors. Boxes of empty autoinjectors has been added to research.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The research centrifuge will now only fill everything in the centrifuge uniquely if the input container has more than one chemical. Otherwise it will try to fill everything up.</li>
