			<h2 class="date">25 May 2021</h2>
			<h3 class="author">50RemAndCounting updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="experiment">Added a Surgical Webbing Vest to the synthetic gear vendor and the field surgery supplies room in medbay, a new webbing type that can hold only surgical tools and nothing else. Can currently hold the entirety of current surgical tray's contents, values and stats subject to future change. Sprites done by Nauticall!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the M3A1 pattern Synthetic Utility Vest, an M3-VL ballistics vest variant which offers no protection and can be used by synthetics.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed the Synth Councillor gear preset to spawn with the leather satchel instead of the standard USCM satchel to be more in line with the rest of the council-exclusive fancy clothing.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">TheDonkified updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscdel">Default BYOND statusbar.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Custom status bar that is above input now and properly changes between darkmode and lightmode.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a preference for hiding the statusbar.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Vanagandr updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Using a bayonet to cut the sleeves off of uniforms fixed - no more spamming cutting on uniforms that have already had their sleeves removed, plus the safety check now functions and means you won't honk your uniform if it doesn't have cut sleeve sprites.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Patches/armbands no longer display on-mob if the uniform's sleeves were cut off.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Patches/armbands now show on marine snow uniforms with their collar rolled or cut off.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Can now pin medals onto mobs properly. This includes yourself, as well as other people. Existing code, but terribly broken. Added some safety checks while I was at it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Can now perform unga macho bullshit medal award ceremonies by harm-intent punching the medal into the recipient's flesh.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Attaching clothing accessories to jacket items with inventories no longer tries to put them into storage, breaking the overlay sprite.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">A variety of jacket-type items can now have accessories attached to them. For ex. detective/CMB jackets, pilot flak jacket, hazard vests, labcoats. Marine service/dress/officer jackets already had this. Exactly which categories an item can take depends on it, IE vests can't have armbands or patches, CMB/detective jacket already have badges where a medal would go, CO dress and bomber jackets have bling or fur where rank tabs would attach. Rank tabs only attach to marine service/dress jackets. No jacket- or suit-type item can attach webbings or shoulder holsters. If you attach a flashy hooah moto patch to your ghillie suit and the CLF counter-snipers get you, it's your own fault.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can also hang medals off of most armours, but remember that bling makes for a good bullseye. Also, it will fall off of your armour when the medic removes it to zap you back to life.</li>
				<li class="tweak">When spawning in, the game now attempts to attach playtime medals to your jacket/armour first, if possible.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Screaming after being splashed with xeno blood now checks if YOU can feel pain, rather than the xeno who did the bleeding.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Misc. typo fixes, minor code adjustments to facilitate the above changes.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Being shot while wearing a ceramic plate now has the impact flash effect.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The nailgun can now PB-staple mobs to surfaces or inflict superslow at angles other than the cardinal, and detects those surfaces much more consistently. Anything bigger than a T1 was and is exempt.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Modified PB backend a bit for efficiency, shouldn't have any visible effect. Any issues would probably be with the under-extinguisher failing to fire, but testing shows no issues.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Attachable guns now track their own last-fired time, fixing them sometimes having enormous fire delays when activated after firing the host gun. This also means firing an underbarrel attachment doesn't put the main gun on cooldown.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed inability to switch between activable abilities while incapacitated. In practice, this means you can switch between lunge, fling, etc. while stunned as a Xenomorph.

			<h3 class="author">Vanagandr updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixes click delay bug I introduced with inserting items into the inventory screen of worn/carried storage items (belts etc) and internal storages (webbings, spec GL). Putting things into a worn/carried storage item should not be affected by action delay; taking items out should.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Due to a code simplification, interacting with an item in a storage item using another item applies action delay again, if the storage isn't in your inventory. Example: pouring liquid into a beaker which is inside a satchel.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Tables and racks are now 'transparent' for the purposes of adjacency checks, IE it calculates as though the item were sitting on the same tile as the table. This fixes a bug I introduced with not being able to insert items into the inventory screen of a storage item on a table (surgery tray) and probably fixes something else somewhere also.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Click delay for interacting with tables+racks moved to their code, rather than being checked for by all clicks. Additionally, the 0.2s delay is now specifically for putting items on surfaces, rather than also applying to interacting with items which are on a surface. Example: pouring liquid into a beaker which is on a table.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Halved the amount of time for weeds to grow (10->5 seconds) and for weeds to decay after their nodes are destroyed (20->10 seconds).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Explosions deal between 2%-10% of their severity as damage to weeds instead of RNG based on damage thresholds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Upped normal weed health from 1 to 5. Boot knives and bayoneted guns should still one-hit normal weeds, but non-bayoneted guns and other items with force less than 15 will no longer one-hit normal weeds.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Refactors xenomorph attack click delay behaviour. Xeno attacks now count as a full-delay XENO_ATTACK_ACTION, 0.4 second XENO_NONCOMBAT_ACTION, zero delay XENO_NO_DELAY_ACTION, or half-delay. Error messages have no delay. This does mean 'You can't do that!'-type messages are spammable, but only the user can see those.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">A missed xeno melee attempt now has a half-delay and audio-visual feedback, plus a message. Should make the true causes of 'eaten clicks' more apparent.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Xenos can no longer click tiles to attack mobs in them. The functionality still exists but is now accessed indirectly through directional attacks and the next change. Weeds & blood etc. often blocked this anyway.</li>
				<li class="tweak">As a xeno, clicking your own sprite now attacks the tile underneath the mouse pointer. This means that you will no longer miss otherwise-viable attacks because your own dummy thicc sprite got in the way.</li>
				<li class="tweak">If conducting a tile attack where you and a prone enemy are on the same tile, it will now attempt to target the enemy rather than the standing mob (you).</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Nibbling allied xenos removed: no attack delay for harm-intent clicking them.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Timed xeno actions (as distinguished from ability actions) such as tipping vending machines etc. now apply delays when they *start*, rather than when they finish.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Attack delay for missing a directional attack is now 0.25 seconds, down from (usually) 1 second.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Directional attacks now calculate angles more precisely, so your mouse doesn't need to be perfectly lined up to attack in a cardinal direction.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The non-help intent self-harm preference toggle doesn't apply to xenomorphs anymore, as they can't do anything to themselves unless someone someday gives them weapon items. This prevents the toggle from messing you up when you click your own sprite while trying to attack someone.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed the layer of the residue left by an abandoned ovipositor so that it's above weeds and weed nodes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added xeno attack animation to slashing resin, resin nests, dropship chairs, claymores, broken powerloader wreckage, discarded ovipositor object, empty eggs, resin fruits, tipping vending machines.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Only attacks on mobs add to xeno slash stats. Previously all xeno clicks did, making it a useless statistic.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Xenos no longer need to be on harm intent to open lockers.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Xeno snow clearing must be done on disarm or grab intents, as harm intent counts as a missed slash and help intent does nothing.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Clicking resin structures (spikes, sticky resin etc.) on help intent applies no delays.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Numerous changes to storage items, mostly cosmetic.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Accessing a storage item now visibly opens it, if it has open/close sprites. Closing the inventory window also closes the item. This applies to backpacks, satchels, belts, pouches, G8s, first-aid kits, pill bottles, and the vehicle internal storage locker. Looks pretty good generally; a bit weird on first aid kits, but the consistency is worth it I think.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">An item that can't be dumped out will no longer show an unusable Toggle Tile Dumping verb.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Attempting to empty an already empty item now fails. Didn't make sense you could keep dumping it out over and over when there was nothing in it.</li>

				<li class="tweak">You can no longer spam storage opening sounds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Inventory storage now closes when you die, to prevent cute bugs with items that suddenly pop closed when the owner finally gets around to ghosting or logging out.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Opening/closing vehicle storage lockers plays SFX.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Renamed storage 'close()' proc to 'storage_close()' so that looking for the damned thing in the code isn't like pulling teeth.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now dump pills from one pill bottle to another. Just click on one while holding the one you want to dump out.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Adds open/closed overlays for pill bottles. Also shows when empty.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The pistol pouch now visually displays holstered guns.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The UPP knife pouch spawned with 10 knives but could only hold 5. Modified it to be loaded with 5 UPP bayonets instead of the usual throwing knives, in line with what appeared to be the original intention.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Gunbelts adjusted - ones that can take both automatic pistols and the M44 now use different sprite coords for each, vastly improving appearance. Tweaked mortarbelt base coords.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Extended when-equipped mouse opacity changes (letting a click anywhere on its 32x32 area count as a direct click) on belts to include belts worn on armour (gunbelt only, I believe) and the G8 pouch generally, which for whatever reason is not actually a Belt-type item.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Lockable backpacks open when clicked like other packs, and when doing so display an unlocked overlay whether locked or not.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the Smartpack not properly displaying contents overlays.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the delay in opening a worn backpack running twice.</li>
