			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">renamed the \"experimental vendor\" to the \"experimental tools vendor\"</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added the experimental tools token to the synthetic uniform vendor, one per synthetic. Inserting this token into the experimental tools vendor gives it 45 points, and is how each synthetic will get their points. Each time you insert one it will add 45 points to the point tally of the vendor. This avoids issues with latejoins and second synths not being able to get synthtools. Survivor synths cannot vend these tokens.</li>
				<li class="tweak">in lieu of the above changes, the synthetic experimental tools vendor now starts with zero points, you must insert an experimental tools token to acquire them.</li>
