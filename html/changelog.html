			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed inability to switch between activable abilities while incapacitated. In practice, this means you can switch between lunge, fling, etc. while stunned as a Xenomorph.

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Vanagandr updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixes click delay bug I introduced with inserting items into the inventory screen of worn/carried storage items (belts etc) and internal storages (webbings, spec GL). Putting things into a worn/carried storage item should not be affected by action delay; taking items out should.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Due to a code simplification, interacting with an item in a storage item using another item applies action delay again, if the storage isn't in your inventory. Example: pouring liquid into a beaker which is inside a satchel.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Tables and racks are now 'transparent' for the purposes of adjacency checks, IE it calculates as though the item were sitting on the same tile as the table. This fixes a bug I introduced with not being able to insert items into the inventory screen of a storage item on a table (surgery tray) and probably fixes something else somewhere also.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Click delay for interacting with tables+racks moved to their code, rather than being checked for by all clicks. Additionally, the 0.2s delay is now specifically for putting items on surfaces, rather than also applying to interacting with items which are on a surface. Example: pouring liquid into a beaker which is on a table.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Refactors xenomorph attack click delay behaviour. Xeno attacks now count as a full-delay XENO_ATTACK_ACTION, 0.4 second XENO_NONCOMBAT_ACTION, zero delay XENO_NO_DELAY_ACTION, or half-delay. Error messages have no delay. This does mean 'You can't do that!'-type messages are spammable, but only the user can see those.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">A missed xeno melee attempt now has a half-delay and audio-visual feedback, plus a message. Should make the true causes of 'eaten clicks' more apparent.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Xenos can no longer click tiles to attack mobs in them. The functionality still exists but is now accessed indirectly through directional attacks and the next change. Weeds & blood etc. often blocked this anyway.</li>
				<li class="tweak">As a xeno, clicking your own sprite now attacks the tile underneath the mouse pointer. This means that you will no longer miss otherwise-viable attacks because your own dummy thicc sprite got in the way.</li>
				<li class="tweak">If conducting a tile attack where you and a prone enemy are on the same tile, it will now attempt to target the enemy rather than the standing mob (you).</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Nibbling allied xenos removed: no attack delay for harm-intent clicking them.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Timed xeno actions (as distinguished from ability actions) such as tipping vending machines etc. now apply delays when they *start*, rather than when they finish.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Attack delay for missing a directional attack is now 0.25 seconds, down from (usually) 1 second.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Directional attacks now calculate angles more precisely, so your mouse doesn't need to be perfectly lined up to attack in a cardinal direction.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The non-help intent self-harm preference toggle doesn't apply to xenomorphs anymore, as they can't do anything to themselves unless someone someday gives them weapon items. This prevents the toggle from messing you up when you click your own sprite while trying to attack someone.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed the layer of the residue left by an abandoned ovipositor so that it's above weeds and weed nodes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added xeno attack animation to slashing resin, resin nests, dropship chairs, claymores, broken powerloader wreckage, discarded ovipositor object, empty eggs, resin fruits, tipping vending machines.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Only attacks on mobs add to xeno slash stats. Previously all xeno clicks did, making it a useless statistic.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Xenos no longer need to be on harm intent to open lockers.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Xeno snow clearing must be done on disarm or grab intents, as harm intent counts as a missed slash and help intent does nothing.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Clicking resin structures (spikes, sticky resin etc.) on help intent applies no delays.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Numerous changes to storage items, mostly cosmetic.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Accessing a storage item now visibly opens it, if it has open/close sprites. Closing the inventory window also closes the item. This applies to backpacks, satchels, belts, pouches, G8s, first-aid kits, pill bottles, and the vehicle internal storage locker. Looks pretty good generally; a bit weird on first aid kits, but the consistency is worth it I think.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">An item that can't be dumped out will no longer show an unusable Toggle Tile Dumping verb.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Attempting to empty an already empty item now fails. Didn't make sense you could keep dumping it out over and over when there was nothing in it.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Activating a storage item in hand will attempt to empty it automatically, if that's possible. If it's empty and can be folded, activating it will attempt to fold it.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can no longer spam storage opening sounds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Inventory storage now closes when you die, to prevent cute bugs with items that suddenly pop closed when the owner finally gets around to ghosting or logging out.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Opening/closing vehicle storage lockers plays SFX.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Renamed storage 'close()' proc to 'storage_close()' so that looking for the damned thing in the code isn't like pulling teeth.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now dump pills from one pill bottle to another. Just click on one while holding the one you want to dump out.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Adds open/closed overlays for pill bottles. Also shows when empty.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The pistol pouch now visually displays holstered guns.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The UPP knife pouch spawned with 10 knives but could only hold 5. Modified it to be loaded with 5 UPP bayonets instead of the usual throwing knives, in line with what appeared to be the original intention.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Gunbelts adjusted - ones that can take both automatic pistols and the M44 now use different sprite coords for each, vastly improving appearance. Tweaked mortarbelt base coords.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Extended when-equipped mouse opacity changes (letting a click anywhere on its 32x32 area count as a direct click) on belts to include belts worn on armour (gunbelt only, I believe) and the G8 pouch generally, which for whatever reason is not actually a Belt-type item.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Lockable backpacks open when clicked like other packs, and when doing so display an unlocked overlay whether locked or not.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the Smartpack not properly displaying contents overlays.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the delay in opening a worn backpack running twice.</li>

			<h3 class="author">Vanagandr updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Removed attack_speed delay when clicking one item with another when in storage (backpacks pouches etc.). Delay varied based on attacking item.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced delay when putting items on tables/racks. Delay varied based on item, is now 0.2 seconds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed extra delay when picking up an item not in first-layer inventory (in backpack, on table, on floor etc.). Total delay was 0.6 seconds, is now 0.2. The pickup verb 0.8 second delay was not changed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed extra delay when clicking things in inventory with an open hand. If an item in pocket, clothing, opening a pouch etc. total delay was 0.05 seconds, now 0; if drawing item from fast-draw toggled pouches etc. total delay was 0.25 seconds, is now 0.2.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Clicking the inventory spacers in slotless storage items (satchels, backpacks, some boxes) now behaves exactly the same as clicking the item sprites directly. With the item-removal click delays now 0.2s across the board, the main effect of this is that you can't pull things (M15...) out of your satchel while resting or in a xeno stomach.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Can't attempt to throw stuff at objects inside storage items anymore.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Updated mob/../carbon attackhand to add the attack delay to the *attacker* rather than the victim. Originally they all had this code but humans and xenos were updated to their current state while /carbon was left unchanged. Being punched/disarmed should no longer add action delay to you. Note that this is for human -> human or human -> xeno attacks with an open hand; this had nothing to do with xeno -> human attacks.</li>
