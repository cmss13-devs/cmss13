This is a problem because it is one of the things stacking power onto t3s and combat queen, forcing lower tiers to sit in the back, either sidelining or waiting for evo.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Each techtree has 3 tiers. Marines get 3 different permanent techs per tier and some repeatable techs that can be purchased multiple times (req points/OBs). Xenos get 2 different permanent techs and 2 different powerups each tier. Powerups can be purchased multiple times to provide different temporary/limited use abilities and effects.</li>

The controller can choose to hand this power to the other side if they so choose using the tech management console in CIC. They cannot be forced to give up this power and additionally cannot be forced to purchase any techs if the controller is either the CO/XO. If someone else is in control of techwebs, a person of a higher ranking may take over by going to this console and using it. Leaving the almayer z-level will result in the person in control of techwebs to lose their control - You must be on the Almayer z-level to control techwebs.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Weapons set to burst can now be fired point-blank.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">While the first shot in a PB is still perfectly accurate, subsequent shots in a burst check accuracy as usual. At PB range, this mostly only matters to people trying to onehand massively inaccurate weapons. Shotgun pellets still count as the first shot.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Missed PB burst projectiles fly safely into the ground or ceiling -- unless, as mentioned above, you move apart. If the target is prone and you move away from it, the fact that the bullets are not tracking it means that they will fly over its head.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Pointblank behaviour is based upon the bullet fired, bonus damage against prone targets, and an inconsistent damage buff that depends on which specific gun you're using. If a gun does not do something on a normal hit, it won't do it on a PB.  Unless the ammo is specifically coded to do so, I.E. the nailgun or battlefield execution. Buckshot stunning on point-blank is a characteristic of buckshot, not point-blanks.</li>
