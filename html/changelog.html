			<h2 class="date">18 July 2021</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Jackie_Estegado updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Added IFF inhibitor to plastic explosives.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added IFF inhibitor to SADAR.</li>
				<li class="tweak">IFF inhibitor now only affects the marines.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Gibber can now process xenos.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Gibber now also makes human meat from human corpses, as intended.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Microwave no longer eats items when trying to insert them while its running.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Jeser updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Simplified vehicle movement code further, removing some parts of it. Vehicles still start slower and accelerate to top speed, but driving should feel much better.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed double movement on vehicles.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Wheels and treads now can change 4 vehicle movement characteristics instead of just top speed, allowing more flexible adjustment.</li>
				<li class="tweak">APC is faster and more responsive now, has reduced momentum loss for turning.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Regular tank treads were made to be slightly faster, require moving 3 tiles to reach top speed. Reinforced treads now have same top speed as regular, but take 5 tiles to accelerate to full speed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Overdrive Enhancer movement buff was reduced from 25% to 20%.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Multitile vehicles now belong to one of four possible vehicle classes: weak (currently vans), light (currently APC), medium (currently tank) and heavy, which affects ramming results and, in future, more stuff.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed vehicle bumping code to not use huge if else structure. This means that absolutely anything can easily be assigned some unique behaviour when being rammed by vehicle. Some stuff just gets outright deleted, some explodes, some nicely collapses or dismantles instead of being broken and so on. If something is not being rammed the way you think it should, you can tell me or add missing behaviour yourself.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ramming mobs is now logged, this includes FF logs for ramming allies. Bad drivers will be much easier to spot.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changes in ramming humans: weak vehicle classes (vans) will apply micro knockdown to humans instead of pushing them in front of themselves. Light vehicle classes (APC) will do the same for allies and apply longer knockdown and some damage to other factions. Heavier classes (tank) will apply longer knockdown and damage to humans indiscriminately.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changes in ramming xenos: heavy class vehicles cannot be blocked at all and will drive over most xenos. Weak class vehicles (vans) will push xenos like before, while heavier (APC, tank) classes will push them away from themselves, making it harder to continuously ram xenos over long distances. APC ramming damage multiplier was nerfed from 0.5 to 0.2. Momentum penalty for ramming was reduced from 50% to 20%. Defenders now block only weak (vans) class vehicles, slowdown light (APC) vehicles by 70% and won't prevent heavier (tank) classes from moving at all, but won't receive any damage from being rammed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Crushers ramming vehicles will produce crash effect inside.</li>
			</ul>

				<li class="rscadd">Added a combat click-drag override preference. When this is set and you're on disarm or harm intent, depressing the mouse triggers a click immediately even if you hold it down. Clicking something in your inventory, yourself, or an ally behaves normally, unless you're a xeno clicking with an empty hand. This applies to all clicks, including shooting and middle-mouse abilities.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The game will now only process one click per mouse-down. This shouldn't have any practical effect on the game aside from stopping the above from triggering extra clicks.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Attaching clothing accessories to jacket items with inventories no longer tries to put them into storage, breaking the overlay sprite.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">A variety of jacket-type items can now have accessories attached to them. For ex. detective/CMB jackets, pilot flak jacket, hazard vests, labcoats. Marine service/dress/officer jackets already had this. Exactly which categories an item can take depends on it, IE vests can't have armbands or patches, CMB/detective jacket already have badges where a medal would go, CO dress and bomber jackets have bling or fur where rank tabs would attach. Rank tabs only attach to marine service/dress jackets. No jacket- or suit-type item can attach webbings or shoulder holsters. If you attach a flashy hooah moto patch to your ghillie suit and the CLF counter-snipers get you, it's your own fault.</li>
