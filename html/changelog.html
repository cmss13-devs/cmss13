			<h3 class="author">Waltermeldron updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Adds cryo marines as a repeatable tech that increases by 10 points per purchase. Starts at 10 points.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">10 March 2021</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Carlarc updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Slugs have been reworked slightly.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Slug maximum range is now 8 from 16. Accurate and stun range is 6 from 12.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Slugs no longer daze or debuff T3s at all, instead, they have gained almost double damage and increased penetration.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed miniscope from the HG, MOU53, and M39 as they are counter to the weapon's design.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The reasoning behind these changes is that slugs are an unfun weapon to fight and they heavily shut down and can in fact stunlock T2s and T1s, primarily warriors and spitters, in a 1v1 and lock down lanes at any range, which a single marine should not be able to do with a common ammotype and weapon. This is a problem because it is one of the things stacking power onto t3s and combat queen, forcing lower tiers to sit in the back, either sidelining or waiting for evo.</li>

				<li class="tweak">The reasoning behind these changes is that slugs are an unfun weapon, they piss off xenos heavily. In addition, they heavily shut down T2s and T1s, primarily warriors and spitters, in a 1v1 and lock down lanes at any range, which a single marine should not be able to do with a common ammotype and weapon. This is a problem because it is one of the things stacking power onto t3s and combat queen, forcing lower tiers to sit in the back, either sidelining or waiting for evo, and encourages holding chokes instead of pushing out.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Survivor starting number is now readied players divided by 10.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Firartix updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">

			<h2 class="date">09 March 2021</h2>
			<h3 class="author">TheDonkified updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Full auto works on black tiles now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">M2C will rotate upon click now instead of requiring you to fire first.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Waltermeldron updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Changes the bikehorn notification message to an actual sound file.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds the Xenomorph and Marine techtree. Xenomorphs can enter through the verb in their alien tab called "Enter Tech Tree" and marines can enter through the verb in their "Objects" tab.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Each techtree has 3 tiers. Marines get 3 different permanent techs per tier and some repeatable techs that can be purchased multiple times (req points/OBs). Xenos get 2 different permanent techs and 2 different powerups each tier. Powerups can be purchased multiple times to provide different temporary/limited use abilities and effects.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The tech tree controller for the marine side is chosen randomly between the CO/XO. The controller can choose to hand this power to the other side if they so choose using the tech management console in CIC. They cannot be forced to give up this power and additionally cannot be forced to purchase any techs if the controller is either the CO/XO. If someone else is in control of techwebs, a person of a higher ranking may take over by going to this console and using it. Leaving the almayer z-level will result in the person in control of techwebs to lose their control - You must be on the Almayer z-level to control techwebs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds a new role called RT Operator. This is a squad role and there is 2 per squad. The assistant RTO is the second RTO in a squad to spawn in. The squad lead succession operates as so; SL -> RTO -> Assistant RTO</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added telephones. RTOs get a portable telephone on their backpack.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added droppods. Drop pods are a way of distributing techs. More drop pods (manned drop pod, etc) may be added in the future with this change. RTOs can call down any tech drop pods. Drop pods will gib anything they land on.</li>
