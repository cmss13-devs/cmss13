			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">QM will no longer spam ping xenos if someone not on the ship dies, or if the round has already ended.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The blastdoors in the thunderdome can no longer be busted down.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Kaga updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">The XM42B Experimental Anti-Tank Rifle has been reworked into the XM42B Experimental Anti-Materiel Rifle. This weapon is not currently available through normal gameplay, but may be randomly playtested.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The XM42B no longer requires a minimum targeting distance of 8 tiles.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The XM42B's ammo and related references have been changed from 'anti-tank' to 'anti-materiel' in most cases to reflect the updated identity of the weapon.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased the XM42B's damage from 95 to 125. This was previously updated as part of the M42C's preliminary update.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced the XM42B's fire delay from a whopping 5.6 seconds down to 3. This is still the highest in the family, higher than both the M42A and M42C.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased the XM42B's magazine size from 5 rounds to 8.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The XM42B's ammo now has the Wall-Penetrating trait, as the M42C was previously given. It can now hit multiple mobs, objects, and turfs, with each hit reducing the maximum range. At point-blank, this comes out to a maximum of eight hits.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The XM42B's ammo now deals increased damage to walls and pylons, similar to the U7 Underbarrel Shotgun. This allows it to break most resin walls and doors in one shot, reinforced walls in eight (a full magazine), and Pylons in three shots.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased the M42C's damage from 125 to 150. This serves to further close the gap between its damage per magazine and the M42A's Marksman magazines (750 vs 1050 to 900 vs 1050), reflect its increased muzzle velocity relative to the XM42B despite being the same caliber, and to keep it distinct from the XM42B's new identity.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adjusted the Ghillie Suit's Aimed Shot ability to now work with all Sniper Rifles. By default, this deals 300% damage, but the XM42B and M42C both have special damage calculations with it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The XM42B's Aimed Shot deals 300% damage against large Xenos (375), and 180% to everything else (225).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The M42C's Aimed Shot deals 300% damage against large Xenos (450), 150% to smaller Xenos (225), and 200% to everything else (300). As the ability currently requires the Sniper Spec's Ghillie Suit, beware of the recoil.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cleaned up some outdated code in the M42A's ammo variants.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Stan_Albatross updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">when deploying a claymore its IFF group will change to that of your inherent faction.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">attempting to disarm a claymore not of your faction is likely to end badly.</li>

Overheat limit increased from 30 to 42. Intended to improve M2's reliability  at medium ranges to take advantage of its screen bonuses, while improving its existing proficiency at close range. As an important addendum to the assemble delay, the 1 second time was a product of a previous bugfix and changes to the M56D.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The M2C's overheat threshold has been increased from 30 to 40 shots, while the cooldown rate has been increased from 1.5 points per second to 2 points per second. This has been intended to improve its staying power as an offensive/counter-offensive weapon, which had been greatly strained due to initial balance philosophies for the design.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">M2C can now be rotated and not fired at the same time, middle click in a direction that the active gun is not facing. Common complaint from many user experiences has been addressed with a patch; also who the hell uses middle click to switch hands in 2022?</li>
