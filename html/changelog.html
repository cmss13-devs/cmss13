				<li class="rscadd">Praetorian stat changes: removed pheromones, slightly increased slash damage, increased health, increased explosive armor.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Base Praetorian Passive: Corrosive Acid. Your acid-based abilities apply a stack of acid to your enemies. When a target has 3 stacks and is slashed, the acid stacks are expended, dealing damage.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Vanguard Praetorian Ability #1: Pierce. You use your tail to pierce enemies in a 1x3 line in front of you. If you hit at least 2 enemies, your shield is instantly recharged.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Vanguard Praetorian Ability #2: Dash. Charge through enemies to travel at most 4 tiles. You can reactivate the ability immediately after dashing to damage targets in a 3x3 grid around you. This also recharges your shield if it hits at least 2 targets.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Vanguard Praetorian Ability #3: Cleave. 2 usable options. If your shield is active when the ability is used, the effect is empowered. Option #1: Root the target for 1->2.5 seconds; Option #2: Fling the target back 2->5 tiles.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Dancer Praetorian stat changes: Lower armor, increased speed and evasion, lower damage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Dancer Praetorian Passive: Finesse. For a short time after slashing a marine, you have increased evasion. Hitting a marine with a slash applies a tag used by your other abilities. Missing a click with your offensive abilities adds a short cooldown.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Dancer Praetorian Active #1: Impale. Attack a marine with your tail. Notable change from prev.: does NOT work over cades and has a 1-tile range. If the marine is tagged, stab twice instead.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Dancer Praetorian Active #2: Dodge. Upon activation, gain increased movement speed and lose mob collision for 5 seconds. Cancelled by slashing.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Dancer Praetorian Active #3: Tail Trip. 2 tile range and applies daze. If the target is already tagged, the target is knocked down instead.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Warden Praetorian Active #2: Acid Spray. As related to current, has a long range but a short activation time.</li>

				<li class="rscdel">Removed Railgun Boiler.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Boiler stats changes: Increased health, increased speed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Boiler Passive Ability: Artillerist. Whenever you increase your sight range, you have a 'buffer' of 7 tiles to move before the viewrange increase is cancelled.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Boiler Active #1: Bombard. Target an area you can see. After a delay, launch an unblockable and perfectly accurate acid bomb at that location. The bomb deals guaranteed acid damage and leaves behind a cloud of toxic gas.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Boiler Active #2: Acid Lance. Start charging the ability by activating it once. While charging, progressively lose movespeed. Fire the ability by activating it a second time; the range and damage are proportional to the amount of time spent charging.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added a new Boiler strain, Trapper.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Trapper is designed to be a glass cannon zone controller and powerful siege engine.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Trapper Passive: Sapper. Your increased viewrange now covers less distance, but does not cancel upon movement. Whenever you are damaged, you gain a brief movement speed increase. This recharges after 15 seconds of no damage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Trapper Active #1: Resin Trap. You place a line of 5 traps orthogonal to yourself. Traps last 10 seconds and root targets that fall into them for 2.5 seconds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Trapper Active #2: Acid Mine. Target a tile you can see. After a delay, a blast of acid detonates on the tile. Deals heavy damage to barricades.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Crusher Active #2: Stomp. Heavily slow any targets in a 5x5 AoE. Any targets directly under you additionally take heavy damage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Crusher Active #3: Master of Defense. Gain a temporary shield that blocks the next 200 damage. Any damage that impacts the shield is reduced by 12.5 before processing.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Significantly reduced the stun duration of Warrior's neck grab.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed most of Warrior's neck grabbing functionality.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Significantly reduced Warrior's tackle chance.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a new passive to Warrior, Brawler. Your slashes charge up a pool of shielding. When you slash while your pool is full, you activate the shield and add it to yourself.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Increased Lurker's slash damage</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Lurker Active #1: Pounce. Roughly the same as before, but only knocks over tallhosts while invisible.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Pounce only cancels the Lurker's invisibility if it successfully hits a human.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Lurker Active #2: Invisibility. Makes you invisible for a maximum of 30 seconds. While invisible, your speed is increased and is further increased by the distance between you and your nearest ally (maximized at 40 tiles).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Offensive actions, like pouncing and slashing, cancel your invisibility.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Your cooldown starts after your invisibility ends one way or another, and is always 15 seconds long.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Lurker Active #3: Crippling Strike. Resets click delay. Your next slash deals 50% additional damage and slows the target.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Reworked Spitter.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Spitter stat changes: Removed evasion, decreased movespeed.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed Vomitter Spitter.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Spitter Passive Ability: Corroder. Your spits apply a DoT effect to targets. This can only be used against the same target once every 15 seconds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Spitter Active Ability #1: Acid Spit. Higher DPS than before, but much more effective versus groups.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Spitter Active Ability #2: Frenzy. Increase your movement speed drastically for 3.5 seconds. Applying an Acid DoT refreshes Frenzy's cooldown.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Spitter Active Ability #3: Acid Spray. If you hit a target with an active acid DoT, you detonate it, dealing all its remaining damage and bonus damage on top.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Reworked Runner.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Removed default round start buff to upgrade and evolution for xenos</li>
				<li class="tweak">Evolution and Upgrade speed is now tied to number of xenos (more xenos, less upgrade), marines (more marines, more upgrade) and time (more time, more upgrade). To top it off, it is all finally related to number of Larva. If you have no larva, this bonus is not applied. The more larva you have, the proportionally more upgrade speed you will have. These effects are active only when queen is in ovipositor or first few minutes of the round.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Example, 100 marines, 10 xenos and 30 larva. Boost is 6.5x for the first ten minutes then it goes to 13x if NO XENOS JOIN after 40 minutes. If xenos keep joining as larva numbers lower, it will taper down, it will be about 1x when there are no larva left.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Returned basic increase for first 30 minutes for upgrade level and evolution. Now it's a maximum of two systems, whatever is bigger will be applied.</li>

Scan them with the Forensic Scanner and insert the scanner in the Security Records computer. Read Fingerprint to see who did the crime and clear the scanner to scan new prints.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Structural damage done to Almayer will now be announced for the whole ship. Destroying walls and windows. It is in our best interest to keep the ship whole.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Scout cloak rework. It is now toggleable and lasts forever, but when cloaked you are unable to shoot guns. Decloaking will leave you unable to shoot for a short while. When cloaked you have 100% chance to evade friendly bullets. So friendlies are unable to shoot you.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced the M4RA burst-fire fire delay. Reduced the burst amount to 2. Increased the magazine count to 16.</li>
				<li class="tweak">M4RA minimum required distance is now 4 tiles instead of 6, this means there is only an accuracy penalty for targets within the first 4 tiles.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Holding the objectives/phoron nodes will now slowly grant DEFCON to marines and hidden points to xenos. When the hidden points reach a threshold, a XRT will be sent in. This is to hopefully help against stalemates. Points gain and so on are experimental.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added four specialist kits as a DEFCON 2 reward.</li>
				<li class="tweak">DEFCON points and ASRS now use money to fund instead of points.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Xenos who are not fire immune will no longer recover health when on fire.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Xenomorph Hive Structures have been added to the game. Special construction nodes can be built by builder castes, leaders, or the queen depending on the desired restriction set by the queen at any time. Most structures require special hive weeds to be built and require Plasmagas as a construction resource, which can be gathered and delivered to construction nodes by builder castes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Plasmagas to the game. Plasmagas is a resource found on key locations of the map and can be gathered by both factions to give them advantages on the field.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added hive collectors, built by the resin construction ability when targetting a resource node or a tile with a resource node present. Gathers 1 resource per 10 seconds and puts it into the hive resource pool.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Plasmagas nodes will span in three categories, Hive, LZ, and Primary nodes will spawn depending on events triggered during the round.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hive resource nodes will appear after the first hive core has been built, selecting whichever node is closest to the hive position.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">LZ resource nodes will appear next to whichever landing zone was picked by the marines at the start of the round, after the takeoff cooldown has passed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Primary resource nodes will appear in central and key positions in the map, and will start appearing after 25 minutes have passed. Once a primary node has been depleted, depending on the player population, a new primary node will appear closer to whichever faction has gathered the least resources.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the ability to see resource node locations via the hive and command tacmaps.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the hive core, a hive structure that acts as a centrepiece to all hives by growing hive weeds and stockpiling Plasmagas.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the hive pylon, a remote structure that also grows hive weeds in a smaller radius as well as acting as a remote location from the hive to build hive structures and access the hive Plasmagas stockpile.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hive pylons and cores will strengthen celings above them by 1 to 2 levels if the area they encompass is already rooved. This will stop air support from being effective around hive locations.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the spawn pool, a hive structure that can be fed bursted corpses in order to respawn a single xenomorph that was killed in action. Spawning can be disrupted by either killing the queen or destroying the pool.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the egg morpher, a hive structure that can be fed bursted corpses in order to generate a total of 6 facehuggers (per corpse) gradually without the need of an egg. Also fires at intruders in a larger radius than normal eggs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the evolution pod, a hive structure that offers a bonus of 0.2 evolution per tick to all xenomorphs on weeds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the recovery node, a hive structure that slowly recovers oen xenomorph at a time when resting adjacent to it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hives will now have a reduced rate of burrowed larvae after 25 minutes into the round. You will need to gain captures in order to efficiently grow your hive.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Default monkey spawns have been reduced from 25 to 5. Extra monkies from survivor spawns have been removed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Young xenomorphs have been made significantly weaker. Later maturations have remained the same stat-wise.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Xenomorph acid splashback no longer stacks and has a cooldown applied before the next splashback can occur.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Multibursting has been removed.</li>
