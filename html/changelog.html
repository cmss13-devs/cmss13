Inserting this token into the experimental tools vendor gives it 45 points, and is how each synthetic will get their points. Each time you insert one it will add 45 points to the point tally of the vendor. This avoids issues with latejoins and second synths not being able to get synthtools. Survivor synths cannot vend these tokens.</li>
				<li class="tweak">in lieu of the above changes, the synthetic experimental tools vendor now starts with zero points, you must insert an experimental tools token to acquire them.</li>

				<li class="experiment">Nerfed the HPDP grenade. It now deals 40 damage per tick from 50. Aliens and Hunters take 25% reduced damage in Phosphorus Smoke (30 per tick). Firestacks remain at 5 added per tick. Keep in mind phosphorus smoke deals TRUE BURN DAMAGE, in that it ignores fire resistance and armor, which is why its so nasty to Hunters.</li>
				<li class="experiment">HPDP grenades on the Almayer and those available to marines release a weaker version of WP smoke compared to those employed by MARSOC. They deal 30 damage per tick, and Aliens and Hunters take 50% reduced damage from this variant (15 per tick). Firestacks remain at 5 added per tick.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added knife webbing to req. It is a webbing vest that can hold 5 knives.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The new first-aid pouch injectors can be refilled at nanomeds, and wey-meds. Left click the used injector onto a powered and applicable device.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Resprited the bronze heart medal.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added gun oil, helmet netting, helmet rain covers, USCM flair, and the M5 integrated gasmask to squad uniform supply vendors.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the 88 Mod 4 burst stock, enabling burst fire and massively buffing the weapon into a primary. While attached, the weapon cannot fit into a holster and must be worn on the armor. Currently admin spawn only.</li>
