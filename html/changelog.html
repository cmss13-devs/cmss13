				<li class="rscadd">Introduces M2C Heavy Gunner Kit to Main Req Vendors at a limited scale (four per round, no more no less), this kit is built to act as a vanguard/flanking fire support using its C4 to breach through walls and barriers, and automatic machine gun to deal high damage in an immediate effect and area.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The M2C Heavy Gunner Kit comes with 2 sticks of C4, a tool pouch with an industrial welder, a crowbar, a wrench and an fire extinguisher to help with creating breaches in fences, cades or doors, a M10 Technician Helmet to shield the user's eyes, a pamphlet for engineering training and a M2C Heavy Machinegun System along with 500 rounds of ammunition in 125-round ammo boxes with a holster to stow this ammo. This kit is heavily designed for short and decisive attacks, and creating new flanks for marines to take advantage of to pressure Xenos.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Introduces M2C Heavy Machinegun, an upgraded and revised version of the M56D; it comes with full automatic fire capability and higher damage and rate of fire but less AP than the M56D, along with a more flexible and reactive tripod. However, it also has a debilitating overheating mechanic which limits sustained suppressing fire, or long-term engagements with its limited ammunition supply. Furthermore, it cannot be built near cades (adjacent tiles) in a 3x3 bubble, encouraging aggressive placement and positioning.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds special sound effects for the M2C HMG, including a shooting, overheat-cooling, rotating, reloading, ammo ejecting, and disassembling effect.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds sprites for (dis)assembled and destroyed M2C HMG, ammo box sprites, and sprites for the belt and other tools. (Credit to Triiodine for the gun, ammo and belt sprites)</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Equipping the Ghillie suit (and possessing sniper skills) enables the two abilities down below.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ability 1: Prepare Position. After 4 seconds uninterrupted by anything, enter a cloak-like state. Your collision is removed (you still can get shot by non-friendly projectiles), you become near-invisible, and you enable Aimed Shot. Moving breaks the cloak entirely, and shooting make you more visible for 5 seconds. The shooting visibility debuffs stack and only resets once you stop firing for 5 seconds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ability 2: Aimed Shot. Can only be used while in full stealth. Display a lock-on on the target and channels for 1.25 seconds, then automatically fire at the target if the bullet has a chance to connect (No turf/blocking structure in the way/ Line of sight is still there). The shot is homing, though somewhat dodgeable if you can get an obstacle in time. If the shot connects with the intended recipient, the projectile does a critical hit, described below.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a critical hit effect to Sniper Marksman Bullet. It deals 3x the normal amount of damage (70 -> 210).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a critical hit effect to Sniper Incendiary Bullet. It maxes out the fire stack if they weren't already (they typically are), and blinds for ~2 seconds on Big Xenomorph (including fire-proofed one), ~5 for anything else. (Blind is the eye-blurry effect you've seen on marines).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a critical hit effect to Sniper Flak Bullet. The backlash is removed, but the base damage in doubled (Roughly a wash in term of total damage). In exchange, Big xeno are slowed for 4 seconds, and anyone else is slowed for 7 seconds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Pounces will still stun knocked down/collision-less marine if they land on their specific tile.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Specialist Kits (Defcon 2) gives the specific skill for the chosen specialist, rather than all specialists.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now toggle middle/shift clicking for abilities mid-round in your preferences.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">When using the Synthesis Simulator in AMPLIFY, SUPPRESS or RELATE mode, you now get 3 options for the new recipe component. The chosen component will either replace one of the existing recipe components or be added as an additional component. If you choose to add a rare component in this way you get 1 credit refunded.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tweaked the value of some of the neutral properties.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Synthesis Simulator will now display the expected new OD threshold of a chemical before running the simulation.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Added a new mode to the Synthesis Simulator, CREATE mode. This mode allows researchers to create a new chemical from scratch.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When creating a new chemical, researchers get to choose the properties, OD, name, and the rarity of recipe components.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The cost of creating a new chemical is based on all of the following. The level of each property, the number of property slots used, the OD level and the rarity of each component. Basic, common, uncommon and rare components add a +7, +4, +1 and -5 modifier to the cost respectively. Negative properties and most neutral, depending on the value of the property, decrease the cost rather than increase it. A penalty cost is added for each property above level 5 (+1 at 6, +2 at 7, +4 at 8, +5 at 9, +7 at 10). The minimum cost of creating a chemical is 5 credits.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The properties ATX, ACR, NGN, HPX, TXC and CRS are available for creation mode at round start. Scan chemicals in the XRF analyzer to make more properties available. Anomalous properties can not be added via create mode.</li>
				<li class="wip">CREATE mode does not take into consideration whether the properties you enabled might conflict and cancel each other out. So don't try this, you'll just waste your credits.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed an old bug with how we check if a recipe already exists. This was why researchers more often that they were supposed to, ended up with recipes of 4 or more components and why the simulator seemed biased towards adding more rare components.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Boxer Warrior passive - KO Counter. Every hit against same opponent builds up KO counter. Slashes and disarms give 0.5 counter, while Punch and Jab give 1 counter. Changing target or not attacking target for 5 seconds will reset the counter. This includes abilities and usual attacks.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Second Boxer Warrior passive - Clarity. Boxer warrior can shrug off limited number of adverse effects (like daze and knockdown) before those effects can actually do something to it. Boxer Warrior starts with 6 stacks of clarity and regenerates one point each minute. Uppercut regenerates Clarity based on how much KO points they have.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Jab - 4 seconds cooldown. Range 3 ability that Boxer can use to reduce distance. On hit it does not deal damage, but slows and dazes target for 2 seconds (assuming 0 Endurance). It also resets Punch cooldown.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Punch - 4 seconds cooldown. Range 2 ability. On hit it deals same amount of damage as usual warrior punch, but does not break bones. This ability also pushes target 1-2 tiles away from you, and resets Jab cooldown.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Uppercut - 10 seconds cooldown. If you are near your target you will automatically hit them. On contact it will put your Jab and Punch on cooldown, reset your KO counter and heal you for 5% of max hp times the KO counter. It will also do following effects if the KO counter is high enough (all of them is KO counter is bigger or equal to 9)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have at least 1 KO point during Uppercut it will deal 15 damage per KO point</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have at least 3 KO points during Uppercut it will knock back target. This knockback scales with KO points and will deal damage if target hits wall.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have at least 6 KO points during Uppercut it will knock down the target for 3 (or more) seconds (assuming no Endurance). This scales with KO points.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Upgrade rate and Evolution rate are now the same number.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Xenos start at 3 Evolution rate for the first 10 minutes of the game.</li>

			<h3 class="author">Jeser updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Clicking alive xenomorphs with empty hand on GRAB intent as a human won't result in attempt to grab xenomorph and getting stunned. Yautja and Synths are unchanged. CTRL + Clicking is unchanged.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Clicking yourself with empty hand on DISARM or GRAB intents as a human will check yourself for injuries now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Point Blanks trigger only on HARM intent now.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">TheDonkified updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Middle mouse click will now allow you to give items to other humans as a human.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Middle mouse click will now allow you to climb climbable structures (window frames, tables, etc).</li>
				<li class="tweak">MMB hand swapping is still in, just don't click on a human or structure object that is right next to you. Xenos that use MMB for abilities will be able to use MMB climbing as long as you do not have an ability toggled on.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added a pref for automatic punctuation.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">ThePiachu updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Overhauled internal logic of how power is handled.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a garbage collector to the game. It's basically a background process that will periodically delete junk items from the game to hopefully lower late game lag. The items removed shouldn't affect the gameplay - burnt out flares, empty boxes, spent casings, literal garbage, etc. It won't remove items from your inventory in case you want to hold onto something specifically, and it won't instantly delete newly created garbage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added boxes of MREs and flares, so that Requisitions won't have to send them down in backpacks. Sprites by Triiodine.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed Requisitions crates to use those boxes instead of the loose items.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed Large Supply Crates to do the same (you can find one in Requisitions!).</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed weapon-specific skills (pistols, shotguns, SMGs, etc.) - they were too redundant.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed the Survival skill - it was only used to gate one recipe - molotov cocktail. Now everyone can make those! Just use paper on a bottle of something flammable.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Squished a lot of skill levels down to just a handful. They most often fall under "untrained / basic training (mini-kits) / trained (combat engis, combat medics, OTs, doctors, etc.)". Cut down on snowflake levels for singular roles, like Researchers being worse at surgery, or CEs being better at powerloader.</li>
				<li class="tweak">POs' Powerloader skill has been buffed. The only people with a mid-range powerloader skill are planned to be PFCs after reading a special pamphlet (not in a kit form, but found on colonies around powerloaders).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Some timers have been rebalanced based on the skill changes (like surgery).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Dual-wielding SMGs now has a higher scatter than before (due to removing snowflake SMG skill check).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Shipside Synths will have a new role to play in this new skill system. They will be more efficient at tasks with timers than even the specialised roles. This will mean they can prop up an entire department by themselves, so it will be up to the Command to apply them to the right place. Survivor Synthetics are not as well trained - they are only as good as a single trained individual, but still have the variety of skills to apply themselves anywhere.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Company has recently launched a colony diversity initiative! Not only will the Weston-Yamada colonies not be staffed by clones, they will have actual names and distinct features!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed the corpse spawner system to use Select Equipment system for loading gear, generating names, appearances, etc. This means the generated colonists will appear more varied.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The new USCM protocols have established that walking is now prohibited. All personel must either run or stand still, no inbetween! This extends to every person and creature in the area of operation, civilian or extraterrestrial. (Removed walk intent, it wasn't used anyway, now you will always be running and now have to worry about fat fingering walking intent and dying because of it).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Made WO compile again.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Motion detectors should properly disable themselves when a mob dies, gets hugged, gets buckled into a nest, etc.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Retrieve corpses objectives should display how many points they earn you, not only their completion percentage.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed some unused infrared sight from xenos (we don't use it anyway, it's a whole other BYOND feature).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some null error around holsters.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Dead people's headsets disable themselves automatically. This is for performance reasons. The radios don't disable themselves when you get hugged or nested, so you can preserve that gameplay. To re-enable the headset, just open its menu, it will turn itself on automatically. Hopefully this will improve late-game performance, not having to send messages to 100+ corpses...</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the hivelord's thick resin door's health. It is now actually stronger than a drone's door. (12052)</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the Queen not being able to build nests. (12277)</li>
				<li class="tweak">The type of the two roundstart OB warheads are now random. You can start with 2 HEs, 2 incediaries, 2 clusters or any of their variations. The number of warheads did not change. (12101)</li>

				<li class="maptweak">CORSAT's door access has been tweaked a bit to focus more on civilian access. Core buttons should still work for Marines not to derail the flow of the map.</li>
