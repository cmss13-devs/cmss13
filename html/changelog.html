			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed another way out in to space on SciAnnex</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Nanu updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">CI for GitHub</li>

				<li class="tweak">base prae floor acid now applies 2 stacks on hit rather than 1</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">You can't perform surgery on someone who's being fireman carried.</li>

			<h3 class="author">optimisticdude updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Accuracy from 40 to 75, assemble delay from 1 second to 0.2 seconds, disassemble delay from 2.4 seconds to 1.6 seconds, falloff from 4 to 3, range from 14 to 15, accurate range from 7 to 10 for the M2C. Overheat limit increased from 30 to 42. Intended to improve M2's reliability  at medium ranges to take advantage of its screen bonuses, while improving its existing proficiency at close range. As an important addendum to the assemble delay, the 1 second time was a product of a previous bugfix and changes to the M56D.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The M2C's overheat threshold has been increased from 30 to 40 shots, while the cooldown rate has been increased from 1.5 points per second to 2 points per second. This has been intended to improve its staying power as an offensive/counter-offensive weapon, which had been greatly strained due to initial balance philosophies for the design.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">M2C can now be rotated and not fired at the same time, middle click in a direction that the active gun is not facing. Common complaint from many user experiences has been addressed with a patch; also who the hell uses middle click to switch hands in 2022?</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If back slot is empty, the M2C will automatically be equipped upon disassembly. This serves a QOL to reduce failures to equip by a secondary weapon being blocked in the back first by muscle memory.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Adds colour to the rotating prompts for the M2C. Nothing remarkable to point out.</li>
