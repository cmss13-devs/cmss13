				<li class="experiment">Converted a bunch of hardcoded lists on items and turfs into generate-on-demand lists, which clear themselves after being used. Generally, this should mean the server will have more memory for shenanigans. Bugs to look out for include, cellular automata from explosions not functioning properly, clothes appearing weird on monkeys, and equip and unequip sounds not playing for whatever reason.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Refactored how flora burns, it should no longer turn into a blazing hellfire.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Whiskey Outpost is now a gamemode vote rather than a map vote. It now shows up once every 25 rounds instead of once every 5 rounds. There is no longer a minimum player limit.</li>

				<li class="tweak">reduced the price of the base medkit in said vendors from 6 to 5 points.</li>

			<h2 class="date">20 March 2022</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Vanagandr updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Surgical line is now in doctor and ERT medic starting loadouts, Wey-Med Plus, synth, and antag vendors, and surgical kits. Ditto for new Synth-Graft mentioned below.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Surgical line/synth graft now fits in medical pouch, first-responder pouch, and medic rig belt. Think of it like a hypospray, storagewise - a touch too bulky to cram in the clown car lifesaver belt.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tweaked some ERT loadouts a bit. Mostly moving defibs, health scanners, and suture line from backpacks into lifesaver and medic rigs where possible.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Fixovein/surgical line are now less effective when used to substitute for each other in surgery, since surgical line is no longer unobtainium. Cable coil and headbands were also pushed down a tier.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Standard wound suturing is no longer a surgery and works like kitting, done on any intent but Harm and not requiring surgery mode. Patient pain can cause it to fail. Suturing surgical incisions closed is still a surgery.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Fixovein/cable coil/headbands no longer work for suturing wounds; they can still be used for stitching amputation stumps & closing surgical incisions.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Suture line split into two items - current one to heal brute, new Synthgraft to heal burns.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Can only suture up to half of a wound's damage, the rest needs to be healed normally.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Suturing time now scales based on damage healed: 5 damage = half the time.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Kits and sutures partly stack, kit effectiveness varying to a minimum of 50% healing on a fully-sutured limb. Same final heal amount no matter the order of mixed suture and kits.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Can no longer bandage burns or salve IB, preventing kits being wasted on the wrong wounds. Ditto for ointment/gauze on already treated/sutured wounds: they won't do anything new, so they aren't used.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tweaked bandage/ointment/kit messaging a bit for a clearer distinction between \"you can't bandage because it's already bandaged\" vs \"you can't bandage because there's nothing wrong\".</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">16 March 2022</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Geeves, Triiodine updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">PMCs, UPP, and CLF now have Squad HUDs that appear over their special units, just like the USCM. Factions cannot see eachother's Squad HUDs, only their own.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Mutineers now have a mutiny flag set on them, rather than changing faction. This will avoid oddities with IFF, and also allow mutineers of other factions to exist.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Smartguns now tell you why they can't fire if you don't have the correct harness or backpack on.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a CLF CO role, the Cell Commander. They get some goodies.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">PMC Medics, UPP Doctors, and UPP Medics now get surgical line.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">In an attempt to reduce lag, Faction Clash will disable blood trails by default. This flag can be toggled by admins.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Faction Clash will now prevent POs and DCCs from printing offensive CAS equipment. This can be toggled by admins.</li>

			<h2 class="date">14 March 2022</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Geeves updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Yautja can now take only one clan shield, it doesn't block damage while on the back. When not raised, it only blocks 15% of the incoming attacks (down from 30%), and 30% when raised (down from 50%).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Create Humans staff tool can now place spawned mobs at pinpoint accuracy if you set the range to spawn to 0.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Exiting out of the Set Custom Event Info input will no longer delete the existing info.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added some monkeys to the preset loadouts, so I can more easily spawn monkeys into the thunderdome. I have sprinkled some additional monkey features in for my thunderdome volunteers to discover.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some sprite issues with monkeys, their standard marine uniform, their standard marine armor, and their standard monkey combat boots.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">QM will no longer spam ping xenos if someone not on the ship dies, or if the round has already ended.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The blastdoors in the thunderdome can no longer be busted down.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Kaga updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">The XM42B Experimental Anti-Tank Rifle has been reworked into the XM42B Experimental Anti-Materiel Rifle. This weapon is not currently available through normal gameplay, but may be randomly playtested.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The XM42B no longer requires a minimum targeting distance of 8 tiles.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The XM42B's ammo and related references have been changed from 'anti-tank' to 'anti-materiel' in most cases to reflect the updated identity of the weapon.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased the XM42B's damage from 95 to 125. This was previously updated as part of the M42C's preliminary update.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced the XM42B's fire delay from a whopping 5.6 seconds down to 3. This is still the highest in the family, higher than both the M42A and M42C.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased the XM42B's magazine size from 5 rounds to 8.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The XM42B's ammo now has the Wall-Penetrating trait, as the M42C was previously given. It can now hit multiple mobs, objects, and turfs, with each hit reducing the maximum range. At point-blank, this comes out to a maximum of eight hits.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The XM42B's ammo now deals increased damage to walls and pylons, similar to the U7 Underbarrel Shotgun. This allows it to break most resin walls and doors in one shot, reinforced walls in eight (a full magazine), and Pylons in three shots.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased the M42C's damage from 125 to 150. This serves to further close the gap between its damage per magazine and the M42A's Marksman magazines (750 vs 1050 to 900 vs 1050), reflect its increased muzzle velocity relative to the XM42B despite being the same caliber, and to keep it distinct from the XM42B's new identity.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adjusted the Ghillie Suit's Aimed Shot ability to now work with all Sniper Rifles. By default, this deals 300% damage, but the XM42B and M42C both have special damage calculations with it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The XM42B's Aimed Shot deals 300% damage against large Xenos (375), and 180% to everything else (225).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The M42C's Aimed Shot deals 300% damage against large Xenos (450), 150% to smaller Xenos (225), and 200% to everything else (300). As the ability currently requires the Sniper Spec's Ghillie Suit, beware of the recoil.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cleaned up some outdated code in the M42A's ammo variants.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Stan_Albatross updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">when deploying a claymore its IFF group will change to that of your inherent faction.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added a CLF channel, instead of just using the Dutch channel.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added faction-specific radio towers, you can no longer piggyback off eachother's radio towers. This affects normal gameplay as well, so let me know if bugs crop up.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added faction-specific crew monitoring consoles, no longer will medbay be able to snoop on the groundside enemies. Crew monitoring consoles now look at the worn uniform's sensors, rather than arbitrarily hardcoded values.

Overheat limit increased from 30 to 42. Intended to improve M2's reliability  at medium ranges to take advantage of its screen bonuses, while improving its existing proficiency at close range. As an important addendum to the assemble delay, the 1 second time was a product of a previous bugfix and changes to the M56D.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The M2C's overheat threshold has been increased from 30 to 40 shots, while the cooldown rate has been increased from 1.5 points per second to 2 points per second.

				<li class="rscadd">M2C can now be rotated and not fired at the same time, middle click in a direction that the active gun is not facing. Common complaint from many user experiences has been addressed with a patch; also who the hell uses middle click to switch hands in 2022?</li>
