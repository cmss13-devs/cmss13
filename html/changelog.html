			<h3 class="author">Frans_Feiffer updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">CO's can now choose between vending the M46c, or a Smartgun from their vendors. Drums have been added to the vendor as well and can be purchased for 20 points. The CO's skills have been updated so they can use the new weapon.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a bug where vending barrel attachments (save for the Barrel Charger) from the CO's vendor would instead give laser sights...</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Faction clash now makes defibs ignore armor by default, allowing you to take prisoners if you can secure the body, but admins can toggle this flag as they wish, during normal gameplay too. This does mean I can add colony comms in the future, yes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Yautja can now drag dead people even if they're not in their team.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tweaked the 'Adjust Job Slots' admin command to let them disable roles before roundstart, primarily intended to allow admins to prevent Vehicle Crewman from spawning in HvH if they wish.</li>
				<li class="tweak">During Faction Clash, flashbangs will now be converted into weaker stun grenades, and the amount that spawn will be reduced as well.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The UPP and Dutch minigun has had its damage nerfed (35 -> 15) and armor piercing dropped down a tier. the damage nerf only takes effect during the Faction Clash Gamemode.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Survivors and xenos will no longer spawn during Faction Clash.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Made weather just spawn its object instead of using vis_contents, this might improve performance, might not. If it doesn't, I'll just remove it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Specialist snipers, such as the Sniper spec and the SVDs can now use their scopes during Faction Clash rounds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The CLF leader now has a bit of leader skill to let them plant C4.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Accuracy from 40 to 75, assemble delay from 1 second to 0.2 seconds, disassemble delay from 2.4 seconds to 1.6 seconds, falloff from 4 to 3, range from 14 to 15, accurate range from 7 to 10 for the M2C. Overheat limit increased from 30 to 42. Intended to improve M2's reliability  at medium ranges to take advantage of its screen bonuses, while improving its existing proficiency at close range. As an important addendum to the assemble delay, the 1 second time was a product of a previous bugfix and changes to the M56D.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The M2C's overheat threshold has been increased from 30 to 40 shots, while the cooldown rate has been increased from 1.5 points per second to 2 points per second. This has been intended to improve its staying power as an offensive/counter-offensive weapon, which had been greatly strained due to initial balance philosophies for the design.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">M2C can now be rotated and not fired at the same time, middle click in a direction that the active gun is not facing. Common complaint from many user experiences has been addressed with a patch; also who the hell uses middle click to switch hands in 2022?</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If back slot is empty, the M2C will automatically be equipped upon disassembly. This serves a QOL to reduce failures to equip by a secondary weapon being blocked in the back first by muscle memory.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Adds colour to the rotating prompts for the M2C. Nothing remarkable to point out.</li>
