				<li class="rscadd">Numerous changes to storage items, mostly cosmetic.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Accessing a storage item now visibly opens it, if it has open/close sprites. Closing the inventory window also closes the item. This applies to backpacks, satchels, belts, pouches, G8s, first-aid kits, pill bottles, and the vehicle internal storage locker. Looks pretty good generally; a bit weird on first aid kits, but the consistency is worth it I think.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">An item that can't be dumped out will no longer show an unusable Toggle Tile Dumping verb.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Attempting to empty an already empty item now fails. Didn't make sense you could keep dumping it out over and over when there was nothing in it.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Activating a storage item in hand will attempt to empty it automatically, if that's possible. If it's empty and can be folded, activating it will attempt to fold it.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Renamed storage 'close()' proc to 'storage_close()' so that looking for the damned thing in the code isn't like pulling teeth.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now dump pills from one pill bottle to another. Just click on one while holding the one you want to dump out.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Adds open/closed overlays for pill bottles. Also shows when empty.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The pistol pouch now visually displays holstered guns.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The UPP knife pouch spawned with 10 knives but could only hold 5. Modified it to be loaded with 5 UPP bayonets instead of the usual throwing knives, in line with what appeared to be the original intention.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Gunbelts adjusted - ones that can take both automatic pistols and the M44 now use different sprite coords for each, vastly improving appearance. Tweaked mortarbelt base coords.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Extended when-equipped mouse opacity changes (letting a click anywhere on its 32x32 area count as a direct click) on belts to include belts worn on armour (gunbelt only, I believe) and the G8 pouch generally, which for whatever reason is not actually a Belt-type item.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Lockable backpacks open when clicked like other packs, and when doing so display an unlocked overlay whether locked or not.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Survivor starting number is now readied players divided by 10.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Slugs have been reworked slightly.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Slug maximum range is now 8 from 16. Accurate and stun range is 6 from 12.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Slugs no longer daze or debuff T3s at all, instead, they have gained almost double damage and increased penetration.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed miniscope from the HG, MOU53, and M39 as they are counter to the weapon's design.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The reasoning behind these changes is that slugs are an unfun weapon to fight and they heavily shut down and can in fact stunlock T2s and T1s, primarily warriors and spitters, in a 1v1 and lock down lanes at any range, which a single marine should not be able to do with a common ammotype and weapon. This is a problem because it is one of the things stacking power onto t3s and combat queen, forcing lower tiers to sit in the back, either sidelining or waiting for evo.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Changes the bikehorn notification message to an actual sound file.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds the Xenomorph and Marine techtree. Xenomorphs can enter through the verb in their alien tab called "Enter Tech Tree" and marines can enter through the verb in their "Objects" tab.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Each techtree has 3 tiers. Marines get 3 different permanent techs per tier and some repeatable techs that can be purchased multiple times (req points/OBs). Xenos get 2 different permanent techs and 2 different powerups each tier. Powerups can be purchased multiple times to provide different temporary/limited use abilities and effects.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The tech tree controller for the marine side is chosen randomly between the CO/XO. The controller can choose to hand this power to the other side if they so choose using the tech management console in CIC. They cannot be forced to give up this power and additionally cannot be forced to purchase any techs if the controller is either the CO/XO. If someone else is in control of techwebs, a person of a higher ranking may take over by going to this console and using it. Leaving the almayer z-level will result in the person in control of techwebs to lose their control - You must be on the Almayer z-level to control techwebs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds a new role called RT Operator. This is a squad role and there is 2 per squad. The assistant RTO is the second RTO in a squad to spawn in. The squad lead succession operates as so; SL -> RTO -> Assistant RTO</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added telephones. RTOs get a portable telephone on their backpack.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added droppods. Drop pods are a way of distributing techs. More drop pods (manned drop pod, etc) may be added in the future with this change. RTOs can call down any tech drop pods. Drop pods will gib anything they land on.</li>
