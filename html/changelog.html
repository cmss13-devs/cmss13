				<li class="tweak">Resin whisperer's long range resin build ability's cooldown has been reduced to 1 seconds, down from 2, though the structure still takes two seconds to build. It no longer requires line-based line of sight, if you can see the tile, you can build there. It no longer spams your chat that it's ready again. You can start building the next resin construction before the previous one finishes. If the build progress is interrupted, the cooldown will be doubled.</li>
