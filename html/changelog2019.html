				<li class="wip">Reworked the southern side of LV almost in its entirely, information on what was done is down below. It is highly suggested to take a machete or knife down to the colony now as you have a lot more natural flora to deal with on the colony in exchange for the new FoB changes which were made. To summarize, both LZ1 and LZ2 are highly defensible now but outside their safety is a highly untamed jungle which can be cut or burned down. More updates will come for LV, but for now the main change has been added.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Walled off both LZs on LV, allowing for more secure FoBs and a more set defense for marines with one major entry way and 2 side entrances.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added doorways and walls to the side entrances of the LZs so marines have some starting defences against xenos upon deployment.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New mechanics for cutting down flora has been added. There are two types of blades which can be used. Small bladed weapons and large bladed weapons. Small bladed weapons, like the combat knife, can cut down small vegetation with one hit, while taking multiple hits to take down large vegetation in multiple hits. Large bladed weapons, like the machete, can still cut down all flora in one hit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added bushes and grass-like flora all across LV, these can be cut down with a combat knife or higher bladed weapon in one hit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added tallgrass all across LV, this can be cut down just like vines with a machete level bladed weapon in one hit, while taking 3 hits with a smaller bladed weapon.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed Vines to be able to be cut down by small bladed weapons.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Fire can now burn down all types of flora. Bushes, vines, and tallgrass. Fire still spreads on tallgrass as it used to do.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Fire does not spread on tallgrass anymore, this was changed so vines could be burned down and not spread which would have resulted in a forest fire.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed predator/Yautja wristblades to be considered small blades, enabling them to cut down all types of flora added. Tallgrass, vines, and bushes.</li>

				<li class="tweak">M44 Revolver stock has been changed. It can now be folded to fit in a belt holster or your belt slot, but it cannot fire folded. The stats are the same.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Holsters now care about stocks again.</li>

				<li class="rscdel">Removed a ton of Syndicate items. We are not affiliated with NanoTrasen in any shape or form.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Armor has now random range from hit to hit. It's not big but this is added so no damage is the same from hit to hit</li>
				<li class="tweak">Marine Armor values are completely changed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Endurance is a useful skill now. Survivors have it super trained. Endurance helps you in avoiding IB and Organ Damage. It will help with bone breaks in future but not right now.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Some rarer armors protect you immensly from certain elements (like biohazzard against xeno spit) but are terrible at everything else. Experiment but remember that MPs can arrest you for bad uniform.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Light armor protects you against spit and gives you more speed "compensation" for gun weight</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Medium armor now has 3 pockets inside and has middle armor between Light and Heavy</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Heavy armor protects against explosions, melee and bullets. It also holds your intestines together so you get IB and Organ Damage less often</li>
				<li class="tweak">Masks defend your face against spit</li>
				<li class="tweak">Damage to armor only works after 0.2 of a second pass, so if you shoot flechette or something at xeno, armor only changes after all bullets connect</li>
				<li class="tweak">There is a mechanic with armor that if person is dealt damage much less than the armor, the armor has MORE effect on that attack. Now this mechanic also takes into account current armor integrity</li>
				<li class="rscadd">IB and Organ Damage uses new "armor-damage system". "Armor Integrity" for IB and Organ Damage is your leftover health on the limb, which means that the more limb is damaged the bigger chance you have to get IB or Organ Damage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">IO Suit now has 4 pockets</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Squad leaders, attention! Squad-based requisitions have been added west of your squad preps. It will be your (and your acting variants') job to manage them.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">These requisitions outlets have all three vendors found in cargo, however they have less stock overall. These numbers are not final and will change!</li>

			<h3 class="author">Neth updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscdel">Old armor logic was killed, thrown out of the window and buried.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New armor logic works as direct % damage reduction. If armor is too high compared to damage, further reduction is applied.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Damage for a lot of guns was changed. Health and armor for both sides was changed. Thus there is no point in giving changelog for them... but still see far below.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Armor hardiness is added to xenos. The longer xeno stays in combat, the less effective armor becomes up to the point of being completely useless. Your armor value is displayed to the right as a shield icon.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If xeno doesn't take damage to armor for 30 seconds and is on weeds, the armor regeneration will start. It will take 15 minutes for crusher to go from 0 to 100, and 5 minutes for low armored units like spitters, warriors, hivelords, burrowers.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Smaller xenos have evasion, which basically adds accuracy required to hit hostiles properly. Naturally, castes that don't have armor have this characteristic. Evasion goes better with upgrade for those castes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have more than 60% hardiness you regain armor faster. For example crusher will recover from 60% to 100% in 3 minutes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Warding pheromones no longer give armor and damage reduction. Warding increases needed critical damage to die, reduces damage to armor up to 50% on max level.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Burrowers are stronger in combat so they can be backstabbing semi-combat caste, but they are slow above ground.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Changed how many xeno-larva spawn from latejoin marines.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Queen heal and give plasma are made stronger to accomodate new HP values for Xeno.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Xeno progression is now fixed, so every caste progresses in a same way</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Runners, Drones, Sentinels, Boilers, Lurkers now have no armor and can't get any. They pretty much don't need armor integrity and are expected to get by with just pure health pool.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">CPR can now extend defibbable time for marines if you do it no often that once per 10 seconds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All weapon nerfs have been removed. M41 normal ammo received big damage increase. Slugs have less armor penetration but slugs break armor a lot faster. M39 normal ammo damage buffed. Flechette buffed, buckshot back to old damage values but armor can make it not as good as before. Buckshot should be good against unarmored.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Smartgun is super accurate (because it's smart), deals not very much damage but breaks armor fast.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Sentry turrets are very accurate but suck at armor piercing. Use it against quick enemies and use m56 against armored targets.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">SMG fire rate and damage buffed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Recovery is nullified while xeno is on fire.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Bipod increases rate of fire of sniper rifle by 150%</li>

				<li class="rscadd">L41A Battle Rifle - easy to carry, doesn't slow you down, worse accuracy when wielded than M41A, better accuracy (slightly) when not wielded over M41A. This weapon can't burstfire but can become super precise with the help of attachments.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Battle Rifle uses its own magazines that use standard M41A ammo. Each magazine can contain up to 20 bullets, except extended mag that contains 35 bullets. There is also AP variant with standard capacity.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Battle Rifle can quickly (1 second) detach and attach its barrel attachment.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Battle Rifle can have following attachments: suppressor, bayonet, red dot, flashlight, extended barrel, quickfire adapter, magnetic harness, carbon stock, scope, miniscope, IFTS Mini-Scope.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">IFTS Mini-Scope - Unique attachment for the Battle Rifle. It allows you to zoom with offset akin to miniscope but has no drawbacks/benefits to accuracy or scatter. Scope also gives a small slowdown to movement speed while scoped in. Scoping in takes up to one second.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">IFTS Mini-Scope can be only received by taking mini-sniper kit or being Medic/Engineer and picking it as your free attachment.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">IFTS Mini-Scope has IFF but it also lowers your RoF.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Carbon Stock - unique attachment for the Battle Rifle. Gives Battle Rifle a significant increase in accuracy while only increasing wield delay and size.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Mini-sniper kit now provides L41A Battle Rifle, Supressor, Extended Barrel, IFTS Mini-Scope, Carbon Stock, 2 Battle Rifle AP mags.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Composite Deployable Folding Barricades - barricade that can be deployed in 3 seconds without any training. They can be repaired without skill for 40% of their health. If Folding Barricade took more than 40% of the damage, it's maximum possible health after repairs will lower.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">To collapse barricade, drag its deployed sprite onto yourself. Collapsing a barricade takes 10 seconds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Folding Barricades are resistant to acid (cannot be melted), cannot be jumped over (as if they had barbed wire) but do not slash back. They cannot be rotated or moved, they can be only undeployed and then redeployed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Folding Barricades can only be carried in hands or on the back instead of backpack.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Folding Barricades are extremely rare.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added 4xFolding Barricade to req for 100 points.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a rare requisition only kit - Heavy Support Kit. It conists of: HP Rifle, 1 ammo box for HP rifle, Bipod, Folding Barricade, Welding Tool and Welding Glasses.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added tactical nuke option when reaching DEFCON 1. The tactical nuke can be deployed on the colony to wipe out any living thing from the mortal realm. With a set timer of 5 minutes (pending change), the xenomorphs will be alerted of its activation, and will be shown a pinpointer to its position. The Xenomorph Queen can diffuse the bomb by clicking on it, and this takes 15 seconds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Tank crewmen have been re-enabled as roundstart crew. The tank vendor has been replaced with a tank part fabricator, which starts at 0 points. DEFCON rewards can grant the tank part fabricator points to build additional parts, and the tank only has access to the minigun turret and grenade launcher without this.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tank crewmen now have engineering skills to repair their own tank, as well as better leadership skills.</li>
				<li class="tweak">DEFCON thresholds have been lowered overall.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Intelligence Officer role, for gathering DEFCON intel and point scores throughout the round.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the data detector, a devide that is given to Intelligence Officers to detect objective items, such as intel, xeno corpses, devices, and disks.</li>
				<li class="tweak">DEFCON objective values have been tweaked. You now actually recieve points for recovering xenomorph corpses.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You no longer need the corresponding paper scrap to be able to interact with folders.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Folders will now display their code in their names.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Fulton recovery device, a 5-use item that allows you to send crates, unrevivable marines, dead xenomorphs, and other animals into orbit to be collected by the dropships. They are available from the marine vendors for 30 points, as well as given to Intelligence officers for free.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Fulton recovery system, a new dropship hardpoint that can be used during transit (without requiring flyby). In order to use it, install the system and select it using the cockpit while in transit. Balloons set up by ground-side troops will only last 3 minutes, so pick your targets carefully!</li>

				<li class="tweak">NEW: You can't peek thru signal flares with obstructed roof (so either clear sky or glass roof). You still can fire using those flares but you have to go in blind or work with ground team. You still can follow the fire mission's shooting path without obstruction but only after you start shooting.</li>
				<li class="tweak">NEW: Same for offset peeking. If tile is obstructed, your screen will go dark and you will receive a message. You still can execute Fire Missions.</li>
				<li class="tweak">NEW: Signal Flares has to be ON THE GROUND to work. Not in hand or in backpack. If you pick signal flare mid flight, Fire Mission will be aborted.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Above changes made to prevent queen killing in Ovipositor and some unfair air raids on spawn points. These changes do not completely remove it, they just make so that all parts of the marine forces has to cooperate to acheive game turning actions, and not just PO looking into every flare and jumping from offset to offset.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">PO's can now return their dropship home at any point from a Fly-By mission by hitting Abort. This sets the time left to land to 10 seconds.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">PO's and Queen can now see how much time left to fly.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Most of the round start PO equipment was removed (excluding ammo and few attachments). Points were refunded.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Added signal flares to SL and PFC vendors. Those act as flares that can emit light for less time than normal flare (around 5 times less). However they provide constant signal (until they are snuffed out or melted) to the PO and can be used instead of laser.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Signal Flare Packs can be bought from the Req.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Laser and Laser battery are made cheaper but they hit smaller AOE. Right now they are PERFECT weapon for Strafing Runs but be sure to spread shots, as different lasers hitting same spot is sub-optimal.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Installing a fuel enhancer will allow you to fly longer during Fly-By's.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Fire Mission Mode:</li>
				<li class="imageadd">PO's can set up Fire Missions - basically strafing runs on the surface of the planet.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Everyone in the radius of actual Strafing Run location are warned by loud sonic boom. Sonic boom has BIG radius, YOU ARE WARNED. But run and hide in any case.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Fire Missions should be created after all of the combat equipment has been installed on the dropship, including ammunition.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">In Fire Mission editor you can set up how mission itself plays out and with what offsets from the center (called GIMBAL). Do note, that all gimbals are relative to the direction of the strafing run, so if you do a strafing run south, left will be on the screen's right and vice versa</li>
				<li class="imageadd">While preparing for the Strafing Run you can peek thru the optical scope and see the situation planetside, change direction of the run and offset on that direction. You DO NOT NEED any additional attachments to do this.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">You can continue peeking thru the optical scope and see how your Fire Mission resolves in real time. That lets you trully feel the Xeno salt... or in case of FF Strafing Run... oh boy.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">If any error happens during Fire Mission setup, watch the chat for messages.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Every weapon has a delay in Fire Mission set up, so you can't fill every fire segment. Again, watch the chat for hints if you use incorrect cooldowns.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">GAU has a delay of 2. So you can do Fire-Wait-Fire.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Mini-rockets has a delay of 3. So you can do Fire-Wait-Wait-Fire.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Laser has a delay of 4. So you can do Fire-Wait-Wait-Wait-Fire.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Big rockets have no delay but they only have one rocket.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">FATTY AND NAPALM ROCKETS CANNOT BE FIRED DURING CAS RUNS.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Fire Mission has to have ZERO errors for it to be run-able. If Fire Mission stops abruptly, it's probably because it has error now (most likely no ammo). You have to have enough ammo for ALL of the strafing run. If you see numbers in yellow in the Fire Mission setup, that means you won't have enough ammo for SECOND strafing run. If numbers are red - you don't have enough ammo RIGHT NOW.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Better manual will be soon. So for now some rounds will have a PO Instructor Character explaining it ICly.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Interface sucks, but oh well, it's NanoUI.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">There could be some bugs with you being able to target caves, but note that even tho you CAN target them and WILL fire at them, nothing will happen and you will waste ammo.</li>
