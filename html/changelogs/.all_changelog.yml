  Nanu:
  - maptweak: Fixes LZ on SciAnnex being weedable.
  TheDonkified:
  - tweak: Ported tg's getFlatIcon proc and modified it a bit to compensate for how
      we use planes and how we handle human overlays.
  - bugfix: Alt-click panel should now update the icon for humans when they put on
      new items and should display their bodies properly now.
  Vanagandr:
  - tweak: Tidied my old hypospray code. Main things are that tactical-reloads only
      swap hands if moving an old vial into the inactive hand, and there's text for
      starting to load a vial into an empty hypo.
  - bugfix: Ghosts and xenos and unconscious people can no longer toggle hypospray
      injection amounts, fixed hypospray tactical-reloading vials out of inventory
      not properly updating the storage screen.

2021-03-05:
  Segrain:
  - bugfix: Firesuits and spacesuits no longer grant unintended immunity to pounces.
2021-03-09:
  TheDonkified:
  - bugfix: Full auto works on black tiles now.
  - tweak: M2C will rotate upon click now instead of requiring you to fire first.
  Waltermeldron:
  - bugfix: Changes the bikehorn notification message to an actual sound file.
  - rscadd: Adds the Xenomorph and Marine techtree. Xenomorphs can enter through the
      verb in their alien tab called "Enter Tech Tree" and marines can enter through
      the verb in their "Objects" tab.
  - rscadd: Each techtree has 3 tiers. Marines get 3 different permanent techs per
      tier and some repeatable techs that can be purchased multiple times (req points/OBs).
      Xenos get 2 different permanent techs and 2 different powerups each tier. Powerups
      can be purchased multiple times to provide different temporary/limited use abilities
      and effects.
  - rscadd: The tech tree controller for the marine side is chosen randomly between
      the CO/XO. The controller can choose to hand this power to the other side if
      they so choose using the tech management console in CIC. They cannot be forced
      to give up this power and additionally cannot be forced to purchase any techs
      if the controller is either the CO/XO. If someone else is in control of techwebs,
      a person of a higher ranking may take over by going to this console and using
      it. Leaving the almayer z-level will result in the person in control of techwebs
      to lose their control - You must be on the Almayer z-level to control techwebs.
  - rscadd: Adds a new role called RT Operator. This is a squad role and there is
      2 per squad. The assistant RTO is the second RTO in a squad to spawn in. The
      squad lead succession operates as so; SL -> RTO -> Assistant RTO
  - rscadd: Added telephones. RTOs get a portable telephone on their backpack.
  - rscadd: Added droppods. Drop pods are a way of distributing techs. More drop pods
      (manned drop pod, etc) may be added in the future with this change. RTOs can
      call down any tech drop pods. Drop pods will gib anything they land on.

  Carlarc:
  - rscadd: Slugs have been reworked slightly.
  - tweak: Slug maximum range is now 8 from 16. Accurate and stun range is 6 from
      12.
  - tweak: Slugs no longer daze or debuff T3s at all, instead, they have gained almost
      double damage and increased penetration.
  - tweak: Removed miniscope from the HG, MOU53, and M39 as they are counter to the
      weapon's design.
  - tweak: The reasoning behind these changes is that slugs are an unfun weapon to
      fight and they heavily shut down and can in fact stunlock T2s and T1s, primarily
      warriors and spitters, in a 1v1 and lock down lanes at any range, which a single
      marine should not be able to do with a common ammotype and weapon. This is a
      problem because it is one of the things stacking power onto t3s and combat queen,
      forcing lower tiers to sit in the back, either sidelining or waiting for evo.

      piss off xenos heavily. In addition, they heavily shut down T2s and T1s, primarily

      marine should not be able to do with a common ammotype and weapon. This is a
      problem because it is one of the things stacking power onto t3s and combat queen,
      forcing lower tiers to sit in the back, either sidelining or waiting for evo,
      and encourages holding chokes instead of pushing out.

      and PO hangar office), have had their access requirements removed.
  - rscadd: Replaced all instances of ballistic vests on the Almayer with M3-VL pattern
      ballistic rigs. Same stats, but now with a suit light and magnetic harness compatibility
      (they still suck though).
  - rscadd: Gave the Ordance Techs more buckets and 4 M3-VL armor sets in an emergency
      locker in their office. The buckets are on the racks next to the locker.
