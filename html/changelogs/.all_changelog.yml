      squad's prep, Tank Crew should have their gear load properly, and PMCs should
      be able to use their PMC guns.

  - bugfix: Fixed bug where barricades would sometimes fail to protect mobs on the

      and regenerate plasma as if they were on weeds even if they aren't.
  - rscadd: New Crusher Keystone Mutator - "Faster charge buildup". Crusher's charge
      will start building up 1 tile sooner and will build up a bit faster.
  - tweak: Corrupted Hive can toggle slashing permissions like a normal Hive. You
      should still listen to your human overlords though...
  - rscadd: SCPs can now be contained. As to how - it's up to the playerbase to discover!

  - rscadd: Added a few more colonist gear presets for admins - engineer, security

  - tweak: Speed has been refactored - it's no longer black magic that devs had issue
      handling for awhile.
  - tweak: Speed mutators have been refactored to multiply xeno's speed after everything
      else has been taken into consideration. Expect fastest castes to be a bit slower,
      but slowest castes to be a touch faster. Overall, xenos shouldn't break the
      speed barrier of the game anymore.
2019-02-01:
  Neth Iafin:
  - tweak: Buckshot secondary pellet spread increased so that most of shells land
      2 tiles infort of you but quickly spread.
  - tweak: Maximum and minimum buckshot damage variance has been reduced. It has less
      chance to instakill and less chance to do almost no damage.
  - tweak: No other changes were made to buckshot, so it still damages well even at
      4-5 tiles, but chance of getting hit by all 4 pellets at that range is close
      to none even with attachments.
  Triiodine:
  - bugfix: Fixed a silly with Win-door layering.
2019-02-02:

      Requisitions and Engineering Encryption Keys.
  - tweak: Bayonet sheaths are available for PFCs and at Requisitions.
  - experiment: As part of our cleanup endeavours, the "DNA" datum has been removed
      from the game. The features we were using (blood types, fingerprints, etc.)
      have been ported over, while everything extraneous was removed. At the very
      least, this should greatly simplify the Player Panel for admins.
  - rscdel: Removed a fair bit of peripheral code around DNA - cloning machines, dna
      injectors, DNA-altering and copying viruses and other things that weren't seen
      in the normal rounds in ages.

  - tweak: There is no visual hint about this process, at least yet.
  - tweak: There is a guaranteed less than 1/10th of a second delay for pulling weapon
      from slot or wielding it.
  - tweak: Stock slowdown reduced, fire delay removed. Instead a significant (akin
      to vgrip debuff / agrip buff) Wield Delay has been added, however stock's accuracy
      should make it manageable.
  - tweak: Increased bullet resistance values for most USCM armors. Less damage from
      FF should happen.
  - tweak: Same with other factions. HvH should be FUUUUN. (no it is not, yet)
  ThePiachu:
  - rscadd: As part of its ongoing inclusion initiative, the Company is proud to present
      the Third Generation Synthetic line. They have the same capabilities as their
      Second Generation counterparts, but come in more human-like skin colours meant
      to emulate various Earth ethnicities. All USCM Second Gen Synthetic have been
      upgraded to the Third Generation model (for a nominal service fee). Those wishing

      reloading cache all the time.
  - bugfix: You shouldn't be able to latejoin as a PFC without a squad anymore.
  - bugfix: Supply Drop Console is now properly access-restricted.
  Triiodine:

  - tweak: Motion detector and whistle now come with a HUD icons.
  - tweak: Burrowers now can dig tunnels in ice floors.
  - tweak: Attacking snow as xeno with any non-help intent will start clearing it.

      produce snow patches out of nowhere.
  - tweak: Xeno traps will now let you know if they've been triggered or destroyed.
  - tweak: Destroying a hugger trap now triggers it just like an acid or gas trap.
  - rscdel: As an ongoing effort to remove code we never use, a few things have been
      removed from the codebase. Syndicate, traitors, names of systems, religions,

      and moved mirrors from above toilets.
2019-02-08:
  Cakey:
  - rscadd: Added the ability to select primary landing zones. Dropship consoles have
      been added to LZ2 on all maps and will now only allow the Xenomorph Queen to
      interact with them if designated as primary LZ. The primary LZ can be selected

  - tweak: 'NEW: You can''t peek thru signal flares with obstructed roof (so either
      clear sky or glass roof). You still can fire using those flares but you have
      to go in blind or work with ground team. You still can follow the fire mission''s
      shooting path without obstruction but only after you start shooting.'
  - tweak: 'NEW: Same for offset peeking. If tile is obstructed, your screen will
      go dark and you will receive a message. You still can execute Fire Missions.'
  - tweak: 'NEW: Signal Flares has to be ON THE GROUND to work. Not in hand or in
      backpack. If you pick signal flare mid flight, Fire Mission will be aborted.'
  - tweak: Above changes made to prevent queen killing in Ovipositor and some unfair
      air raids on spawn points. These changes do not completely remove it, they just
      make so that all parts of the marine forces has to cooperate to acheive game
      turning actions, and not just PO looking into every flare and jumping from offset
      to offset.
  - imageadd: PO's can now return their dropship home at any point from a Fly-By mission
      by hitting Abort. This sets the time left to land to 10 seconds.
  - imageadd: PO's and Queen can now see how much time left to fly.
  - imageadd: Most of the round start PO equipment was removed (excluding ammo and
      few attachments). Points were refunded.
  - imageadd: Added signal flares to SL and PFC vendors. Those act as flares that
      can emit light for less time than normal flare (around 5 times less). However
      they provide constant signal (until they are snuffed out or melted) to the PO
      and can be used instead of laser.
  - imageadd: Signal Flare Packs can be bought from the Req.
  - imageadd: Laser and Laser battery are made cheaper but they hit smaller AOE. Right
      now they are PERFECT weapon for Strafing Runs but be sure to spread shots, as
      different lasers hitting same spot is sub-optimal.
  - imageadd: Installing a fuel enhancer will allow you to fly longer during Fly-By's.
  - experiment: 'Fire Mission Mode:'
  - imageadd: PO's can set up Fire Missions - basically strafing runs on the surface
      of the planet.
  - imageadd: Everyone in the radius of actual Strafing Run location are warned by
      loud sonic boom. Sonic boom has BIG radius, YOU ARE WARNED. But run and hide
      in any case.
  - imageadd: Fire Missions should be created after all of the combat equipment has
      been installed on the dropship, including ammunition.
  - imageadd: In Fire Mission editor you can set up how mission itself plays out and
      with what offsets from the center (called GIMBAL). Do note, that all gimbals
      are relative to the direction of the strafing run, so if you do a strafing run
      south, left will be on the screen's right and vice versa
  - imageadd: While preparing for the Strafing Run you can peek thru the optical scope
      and see the situation planetside, change direction of the run and offset on
      that direction. You DO NOT NEED any additional attachments to do this.
  - imageadd: You can continue peeking thru the optical scope and see how your Fire
      Mission resolves in real time. That lets you trully feel the Xeno salt... or
      in case of FF Strafing Run... oh boy.
  - imageadd: If any error happens during Fire Mission setup, watch the chat for messages.
  - imageadd: Every weapon has a delay in Fire Mission set up, so you can't fill every
      fire segment. Again, watch the chat for hints if you use incorrect cooldowns.
  - imageadd: GAU has a delay of 2. So you can do Fire-Wait-Fire.
  - imageadd: Mini-rockets has a delay of 3. So you can do Fire-Wait-Wait-Fire.
  - imageadd: Laser has a delay of 4. So you can do Fire-Wait-Wait-Wait-Fire.
  - imageadd: Big rockets have no delay but they only have one rocket.
  - imageadd: FATTY AND NAPALM ROCKETS CANNOT BE FIRED DURING CAS RUNS.
  - imageadd: Fire Mission has to have ZERO errors for it to be run-able. If Fire
      Mission stops abruptly, it's probably because it has error now (most likely
      no ammo). You have to have enough ammo for ALL of the strafing run. If you see
      numbers in yellow in the Fire Mission setup, that means you won't have enough
      ammo for SECOND strafing run. If numbers are red - you don't have enough ammo
      RIGHT NOW.
  - imageadd: Better manual will be soon. So for now some rounds will have a PO Instructor
      Character explaining it ICly.
  - imageadd: Interface sucks, but oh well, it's NanoUI.
  - imageadd: There could be some bugs with you being able to target caves, but note
      that even tho you CAN target them and WILL fire at them, nothing will happen
      and you will waste ammo.
  ThePiachu:
  - rscadd: PFCs have been given Kits. A Kit is a box that costs 45 kit points and
      will have a variety of items fitting a particular playstyle. Kits will be more
      cost effective than buying individual items from their vendor.
  - rscadd: Current PFC Kits include mini-constructor, mini-engineer, mini-medic,
      mini-pyro and mini-sniper. Those are not nearly as potent as proper Engineers,
      Medics or Specs, but fulfill a similar role with more common items.
  - rscadd: New role has been added - Synth Survivor. You can roll it independently
      of a normal Survivor, but you do need to be Whitelisted in order to play this
      role. If chosen, you start as a Gen 1 Synth on the planet surface. Normal Synthetic
      Guidelines apply. If a Synth Survivor is spawned, xenos will be compensated
      with extra smallhost spawn to balance things out.
  - rscadd: Added a Working Joe gear presets for Admins to spawn as needed.
  - tweak: 'Implemented #5371 - Gen 1 Synths will now change eye colour based on their
      intent.'
  - tweak: M41A armor piercing ammo crate now contains an entire box of AP ammo, but
      is a bit more expensive.
  - rscdel: Removed the flare pack from ASRS random drops.
  Triiodine:
  - imageadd: Added a new piece of lobby art.
  - tweak: Updated lobby art turf description, better credits associated artists.
  - bugfix: Fixed Lifesaver bag icon issues. It will appear on mobs now.
2019-02-10:
  Miraviel:
  - rscadd: Almayer. Added spare medevac stretchers to Medbay (#5530).
  - rscadd: Almayer. Added a guaranteed brown webbing to each shipside engineering
      locker, more empty pill bottles to medicine closets, and cleaned up both (#5590).
  - tweak: Almayer. Cleans up CIC Armory lockers, adds helmets and shotgun shell rigs
      (#5729).
  - maptweak: Almayer. Replaces medical research laboratories' indestructible north
      and south walls with hull ones (#4251). Containment cells are unchanged.
  - bugfix: Almayer. Removes space cameras (#5740).
  ThePiachu:
  - bugfix: Regurgitating people while in tunnel shouldn't cause a runtime error due
      to your location being null.
  - bugfix: ASRS shouldn't try giving you a null box causing the Requisition lift
      to bork.
  - bugfix: You can use tunnels even without a Queen being alive.
  - bugfix: Running a fire mission without ammo shouldn't cause a runtime error.
  Triiodine:
  - imageadd: The M42C has been visually redrawn. Wield sprites added.
  - imageadd: The M240 & M240T have been redrawn.
  - imageadd: The M46C now has suit slot and back sprites.
  - bugfix: The Type-71 and variants have had their left handed wield sprites fixed.
2019-02-11:
  Neth Iafin:
  - tweak: Most of the tweaks are directed at signal flares that were found a bit
      too much when used but at the same time rarely used.
  - tweak: Signal Flares now take time (5 seconds) before they become fully active.
      After that they can't be picked up. You can still push them with explosives,
      but why.
  - tweak: Signal Flare lifetime is now cut in half.
  - tweak: You can't use Signal Flare that was activated on a different level.
  - tweak: Dropship roofs are now metal, instead of nothing, making pilots unable
      to see the target in another dropship.
  - tweak: Prison Civ Quarters now has heavy metal roof. Pilots can't see there directly
      either.
  - tweak: Removed Signal Flares from PFCs and SLs. Added Pack of Signal Flares (5
      flares in it) to SL vendor for 15 points.
  - tweak: Added few packs of Signal Flares to 'ColMarTech automated armaments vendor'.
      Bother your local RO to get some.
  - tweak: Changed sprite of Signal Flare Pack, thanks to Triiodine. Now Sig-Flare
      Pack is called H-89S.
  - tweak: Removed 2 roundstart mini-rocket stacks that were added last week.
  - bugfix: Fixed bug that forced view to reset on ladders, cameras and CAS.
  - bugfix: Fixed lost gimbals on Dropships.
  RavingManiac:
  - rscadd: Acid spray will now reduce or extinguish fires, depending on fire intensity.
  - rscadd: Explosions will clear smoke clouds.
  - tweak: Reduced burst delay of some automatic pistols, as well as the M46C.
  - tweak: Refactored attacks on simple animals. Such attacks now have the save audio/visual
      effects as attacks on regular mobs.
  - tweak: Quintupled line-of-sight embryo incubation bonus. As before, light is not
      neccessary for it to work.
  - tweak: Scary thing made scarier.
  - tweak: Adjusted skillsets of human factions:<br>- The CLF have poor firearms training,
      but make up for it with resourcefulness, plus diverse skillsets from their civilian
      backgrounds.<br>- The Freelancers and the UPP have roughly the same training
      as the USCM, but with additional construction/engineering skills.<br>- Private
      Military Contractors have superior firearms training, as well as security and
      construction/engineering skills.
  ThePiachu:
  - tweak: Select Equipment works on non-humanoids (including observers). If used
      on a non-humanoid, it will turn them into a human first before applying a preset.
  - bugfix: Cryo ERT marines should appear in the crew manifest.
  - tweak: DEFCON's Cryo ERTs no longer announce a distress beacon, but spawn the
      same otherwise.
  - tweak: Faction information is embedded into users' ID. Antag vendors on the admin
      level refer to that ID now. Future items might refer to that ID as well rather
      than using mind's faction. Setting up mobs for an event should be easier with
      this.
  Triiodine:
  - bugfix: Changed X Y attachment location on M240 Incinerator.
2019-02-12:
  Miraviel:
  - rscadd: Prison Station. The grass is diggable now. Added a grass patch to Yard.
  - rscadd: Prison Station. Added a cautery to the surgery room (#4752) and a few
      more welding helmets around the map (#5601).
  - tweak: Prison Station. The ceiling was changed to glass everywhere, meaning that
      medevac/CAS/supply drops are available thorough the entire map.
  - tweak: Prison Station. Xeno spawnpoints were tweaked to allow more options for
      a starter hive (#1986). Survivor, monkey, and predator spawnpoints were changed
      accordingly.
  - rscdel: Prison Station. Medical and Panopticon do not connect anymore.
  - rscdel: Prison Station. Medium Security and Protective Custody do not connect
      anymore.
  - rscdel: Prison Station. Yard blast doors were removed (#5475).
  ThePiachu:
  - tweak: Old Follow verb has been restored. New Follow functionality (for right-click
      follow) is now under Follow Them. Since there is no way of creating a right-click
      verb without also creating a corresponging verb in the sidebar, it's there too
      now.
2019-02-13:
  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: The engineering and construction pamphlets have been merged into one.
  - tweak: The constructor kit no longer has plasteel that the constructors can't
      use. Instead, it has ten more metal sheets.
  - tweak: You can no longer use more than one pamphlet. Don't hog them all.
  - rscadd: 'Added a new PFC kit: the JTAC kit. It contains two packs of signal flares
      and a shiny pair of tactical binoculars. These ONLY spawn in Requisitions and
      cannot be bought at vendors.'
  - rscadd: Alongside the JTAC kits, a new frequency has been added, the JTAC frequency.
      Command radio headsets and SL headsets spawn with this by default. Squad Leaders
      also get the JTAC frequency, and the JTAC kits get its encryption key. Talk
      on it with the :j prefix.
  - tweak: Squad Marines can now select M39 holsters and buy gyroscopic stabilizers
      from their vendor.
  - experiment: The first patch of the Xeno Rebalance is here. This is an experimental
      rebalance aimed at making younger tiers viable in combat, and making latter
      tiers less overwhelmingly strong. Nothing here is final and may change.
  - tweak: Tier 1 Xenos have had their power curve lowered a little. Young Tier 1s
      are roughly equal to slightly better old Mature Tier 1s, with Ancients keeping
      their old strength - however, most of it has been trickled down to lower upgrades.
  - tweak: Tier 2 Xenos have had their power curve lowered. Elder is now the peak
      strength, lower upgrades are about slightly better old Mature levels, and Ancient
      only gives you mutator points and an extra chevron.
  - tweak: Tier 3 Xenos have also had their power curve flattened. Young Tier 3s are
      about midway from old Young to old Mature, while Matures retain full Mature
      T3 strength. Elder Tier 3s and Ancient Tier 3s now receive very slight bonuses
      to stats, and nothing major.
  - tweak: The Queen keeps its old power curve and upgrade timer.
  - tweak: Lurkers have been tweaked to do slightly less damage overall, with pounce
      delay being a little higher.
  - tweak: Upgrade and evolve timers for tier ones have been halved. The time to upgrade
      to mature for tier twos has been halved.
  - experiment: Tales tell of a new, dormant upgrade strain of Xenomorphs, surpassing
      even the old Ancients in strength...
2019-02-17:
  Deanthelis:
  - rscadd: A new autoresponse has been added.
  - tweak: The devour as xeno autoresponse has been adjusted to be accurate.
  - rscdel: Stools can no longer be used to stun things.
  MattAtlas:
  - bugfix: Chainwhip sprite fixed for real.
  - bugfix: Scout specialists should now find a JTAC encryption key in their box.
  - bugfix: Decapitated humans should no longer still have hair.
  - tweak: Greatly increased fire tick damage on Xenomorphs.
  - tweak: The M40 HEDP and M15 should now have a bigger, stronger blast radius.
  - tweak: M12 blast grenades have been slightly buffed.
  - tweak: Damage no longer randomly applies organ damage or internal bleeding. Instead,
      there's now a required amount of brute damage on the targeted area.
  - tweak: Ravager RNG delimb now requires some damage on the targeted limb before
      activating.
  - tweak: Xenomorph upgrade timers are now equal to what they were before.
  - tweak: Metal barricade health has been increased.
  - tweak: Harpoons, vox casters, the chain mesh, relay beacons, and ceremonial knives
      no longer count as Yautja gear.
  - tweak: Entrenching tools now dig up five dirt at once, at the cost of being slower.
  - rscadd: The mortar crate now comes with two JTAC encryption keys.
  - tweak: Predators should now have proper skills when they spawn.
  - tweak: Predators should now spawn with hunting pouches.
  - rscdel: Stat mutators and mutator flaws have been removed.

  - tweak: Added an extra 'You probably need to find its instructions on a paper scrap.'
      sentence to failed folder reading attempts (#5692).
  - tweak: Changed wooden barricades to be climbable and passable by thrown objects
      (#5683).
  - tweak: Changed DEFCON folders and disks to tiny objects.
  - tweak: Reduced the size of helmets and underbarrel attachments to make them fit
      into bags (#5682).
  - tweak: Reduced the time to disarm claymores to 6 seconds (#5741).
  - rscdel: Removed the 'Ring around the Rosie' lobby music (#5727).

  - tweak: GAU can now hit same tile multiple times during fire
  - bugfix: Signal Flares now actually expire
  - bugfix: CAS camera works again, HUZZAH!
  ThePiachu:
  - tweak: G1 Synthetics have been retired from the Almayer. Old G1 players can still
      spawn with them for now.
  - tweak: Synths can now repair their own damage with the appropriate tools. They
      have to do it slowly and carefully not to void their warranty.
  - tweak: Synth survivors now start with a melee weapon by default to defend themselves
      with.
  - tweak: Working Joe suit has been added to Synth Vendor.
  - tweak: Health Analyzers work on Synths now.
  - tweak: Synths should have the default large font on comms now.
2019-02-19:
  Awan:
  - tweak: Removed all ASRS explosive crates.
  - tweak: Made ASRS not spawn crates the first few minutes.
  Cakey:
  - rscdel: Savefiles with unselectable hair styles have been scrubbed.
  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: Fire tick damage has been slightly reduced.
  - bugfix: Predators should now actually have the Butcher and Claim Equipment verbs
      again.
2019-02-23:
  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: The M41A deals less damage.
  - tweak: The M39 deals less damage. M39 AP now deals less damage than normal M39
      rounds, however it gets more AP.
  - tweak: Metal barricade HP has been lowered.
  - tweak: Required damage for ravager delimb reduced.
  - tweak: Increased chance of ravager RNG delimb.
  - tweak: Reduced required damage for internal bleeding and organ damage as the threshold
      was way too high before. You still won't get instant internal bleeding from
      a few slashes however.
  - tweak: Slightly increased Elder benefits for T3s.
  - tweak: M40 HEDP grenade radius has been reduced. Explosion falloff has been reduced
      as well to compensate.
  - experimental: Xenomorph upgrade ratios have been halved once again to compensate
      for the mutator removal.
  Miraviel and Cakey:
  - maptweak: Lower medical has been remapped. Ping me (Miraviel) on Discord if you
      have any feedback!
  - maptweak: The brig has been moved to the lower deck, positioned inbetween medical
      and briefing. The lower deck has been stretched slightly to accomodate.
  - maptweak: Added a gym to the Almayer.
  - maptweak: Added a conference room to the fore of the CIC.
  - maptweak: The officer's mess has been made bigger.
  - maptweak: Added ladders connecting Astronavigation to the CIC.
  Slywater:
  - maptweak: Reworked SD in preparation for making it a distress option. Also tweaked
      it to give xenos the edge.
  - maptweak: Added more pods to lower deck (adjacent to prep).
2019-02-24:
  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: The Mini-Engineer kit now gets welding goggles and tools pouch with a welding
      tool instead of a multitool.
  - rscdel: The sentry safety option has been removed.
  - tweak: Smartgun damage has been buffed.
  - rscadd: Requisitions can now order anti-tank sniper rifle magazines for the XM42B.
  - tweak: The XM42B should no longer miss.
  - rscadd: Primordial Predaliens have been added. You'll know when one is spawned...
  ThePiachu:
  - bugfix: ASRS shouldn't be giving out infinite amount of crates anymore.
  - tweak: Ammo boxes have been re-added to Requisition vendors.
  monkeysfist101:
  - imageadd: Changed drink machines to Souto branding.
2019-02-25:
  Cakey:
  - rscadd: Added tactical nuke option when reaching DEFCON 1. The tactical nuke can
      be deployed on the colony to wipe out any living thing from the mortal realm.
      With a set timer of 5 minutes (pending change), the xenomorphs will be alerted
      of its activation, and will be shown a pinpointer to its position. The Xenomorph
      Queen can diffuse the bomb by clicking on it, and this takes 15 seconds.
  - rscadd: Tank crewmen have been re-enabled as roundstart crew. The tank vendor
      has been replaced with a tank part fabricator, which starts at 0 points. DEFCON
      rewards can grant the tank part fabricator points to build additional parts,
      and the tank only has access to the minigun turret and grenade launcher without
      this.
  - tweak: Tank crewmen now have engineering skills to repair their own tank, as well
      as better leadership skills.
  - tweak: DEFCON thresholds have been lowered overall.
  - rscadd: Added the Intelligence Officer role, for gathering DEFCON intel and point
      scores throughout the round.
  - rscadd: Added the data detector, a devide that is given to Intelligence Officers
      to detect objective items, such as intel, xeno corpses, devices, and disks.
  - tweak: DEFCON objective values have been tweaked. You now actually recieve points
      for recovering xenomorph corpses.
  - tweak: You no longer need the corresponding paper scrap to be able to interact
      with folders.
  - tweak: Folders will now display their code in their names.
  - rscadd: Added the Fulton recovery device, a 5-use item that allows you to send
      crates, unrevivable marines, dead xenomorphs, and other animals into orbit to
      be collected by the dropships. They are available from the marine vendors for
      30 points, as well as given to Intelligence officers for free.
  - rscadd: Added the Fulton recovery system, a new dropship hardpoint that can be
      used during transit (without requiring flyby). In order to use it, install the
      system and select it using the cockpit while in transit. Balloons set up by
      ground-side troops will only last 3 minutes, so pick your targets carefully!
  MattAtlas:
  - bugfix: Queens may no longer set themselves as leaders.
  Miraviel:
  - tweak: Almayer. Medical. Moved the sleeper to the bottom right corner, added another
      body scanner in its former place. Cryotubes were changed to eject patients whichever
      direction they face (west on the Almayer). Removed a cryotube for the sake of
      visuals. Might re-add it later if we really need it.
  - bugfix: Almayer. Medical. Fixed the medical-to-hangar airlock access issues, added
      a missing dropper to the chemistry. Added an access requirement to the CMO's
      personal cabinet and shutters to his office. Moved a wall sign from below a
      light tube.
  - tweak: Almayer. Brig. Isolation cell windows were made super strong. Removed an
      extra potted plant and an APC from processing. Added lights to the security
      office, shutters to the armory. Added access requirements to the shutters and
      the wall-mounted flashes. Moved the fire alarm in the main room.
  - bugfix: Almayer. Brig. Fixed the entry and the two pairs of exit shutters not
      reacting to their buttons.
  - bugfix: Almayer. Fixed the lack of lights in the conference room.
2019-02-26:
  Cakey:

  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: Slightly lowered smartgun damage to saner levels.
  - tweak: Mateba accuracy has been buffed.
  - tweak: Humans with helmets should no longer be able to be decapitated. Synths
      are unaffected by this.
  Miraviel:
  - tweak: LV. Added more larva spawnpoints. Some pre-spawned resin structures were
      changed.
  - bugfix: LV. Reinforced window frames were swapped to normal ones where the wall
      is not reinforced, so acid-users can melt in. Deleted some awkward fog parts
      (#4092). Fixed a floating APC (#4091).
2019-02-27:
  MattAtlas:
  - bugfix: Xenomorphs should no longer lose stats upon upgrading to elder/ancient.
      Oops.
  - rscadd: Added the extended barrel, suppressor and recoil compensator to the PFC
      vendor.
  - tweak: Removed the increased wield delay from the vertical grip. You just move
      a bit slower now.
  - tweak: The Chief Engineer now has squad comms and MedSci comms once again.
  - tweak: The CMP now has MedSci and Engineering comms again.
2019-03-02:
  Cakey:
  - rscadd: Re-added the ship self destruct systems.
  - rscadd: The tank now gets a smoke launcher on roundstart.
  - rscadd: You can now view all DEFCON rewards from the comms console.
  - tweak: Changed DEFCON points per level and reward costs. Point rewards per level.
  - maptweak: Added toolbelts and welding equipment to the Tanker's quarters.
  - maptweak: Reshuffled the CIC to have all seating positions visible from all seating
      positions.
  - tweak: Fulton stacks have been increased to 10.
  - tweak: Added a Fulton Recover Device crate to requisitions.
  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: Predators can now be combat hugged once again, since it was far too hard
      to infect a Predator before.
  - tweak: Spitter acid spit damage has been buffed.
  - bugfix: The plasma rifle should actually do damage now.
  - experimental: M41A, M39, M4RA and the main buckshot shell have all had their damage
      slightly lowered as an experiment.
  - tweak: Xenomorphs should now gain more health earlier in maturity.
  MattAtlas, Triiodine:
  - rscadd: The M5A6 smartpistol has been added. It can be found in Requisitions vendors.
      This pistol fires IFF AP ammunition.
  - rscadd: The M39 arm brace stock has been added. This stock makes one handing much
      better while making wielding much worse. It can be found in the Requisitions
      attachment vendor.
  - rscadd: Light and Heavy armor types have been added to the PFC marine vendors.
      As you would expect, Heavy armor protects significantly more against melee and
      bullets, while also covering feet. Light armor protects less but you run faster.
  - bugfix: PMCs should now actually have PMC IFF. That means the PMC sniper shouldn't
      hit them.
  - rscadd: The smartpistol has its own unique belt that can also be gotten from Requisitions.
  - imageadd: New PFC kit sprites courtesy of Triiodine.
  Neth Iafin:
  - rscadd: All new item sprites are made by Triiodine.
  - rscadd: Added L41A Battle Rifle.
  - rscadd: Added Heavy Support kit.
  - rscadd: Added Deployable Folding Barricades.
  - rscadd: Added IFTS Mini-Scope and Carbon Stock - Battle Rifle's unique attachments.
  - tweak: Rebalanced Marine Vendor costs. Item cost has been scaled to usefulness.
  - rscadd: 'MORE DETAILS:'
  - rscadd: L41A Battle Rifle - easy to carry, doesn't slow you down, worse accuracy
      when wielded than M41A, better accuracy (slightly) when not wielded over M41A.
      This weapon can't burstfire but can become super precise with the help of attachments.
  - rscadd: Battle Rifle uses its own magazines that use standard M41A ammo. Each
      magazine can contain up to 20 bullets, except extended mag that contains 35
      bullets. There is also AP variant with standard capacity.
  - rscadd: Battle Rifle can quickly (1 second) detach and attach its barrel attachment.
  - rscadd: 'Battle Rifle can have following attachments: suppressor, bayonet, red
      dot, flashlight, extended barrel, quickfire adapter, magnetic harness, carbon
      stock, scope, miniscope, IFTS Mini-Scope.'
  - rscadd: IFTS Mini-Scope - Unique attachment for the Battle Rifle. It allows you
      to zoom with offset akin to miniscope but has no drawbacks/benefits to accuracy
      or scatter. Scope also gives a small slowdown to movement speed while scoped
      in. Scoping in takes up to one second.
  - rscadd: IFTS Mini-Scope can be only received by taking mini-sniper kit or being
      Medic/Engineer and picking it as your free attachment.
  - rscadd: IFTS Mini-Scope has IFF but it also lowers your RoF.
  - rscadd: Carbon Stock - unique attachment for the Battle Rifle. Gives Battle Rifle
      a significant increase in accuracy while only increasing wield delay and size.
  - tweak: Mini-sniper kit now provides L41A Battle Rifle, Supressor, Extended Barrel,
      IFTS Mini-Scope, Carbon Stock, 2 Battle Rifle AP mags.
  - rscadd: Composite Deployable Folding Barricades - barricade that can be deployed
      in 3 seconds without any training. They can be repaired without skill for 40%
      of their health. If Folding Barricade took more than 40% of the damage, it's
      maximum possible health after repairs will lower.
  - rscadd: To collapse barricade, drag its deployed sprite onto yourself. Collapsing
      a barricade takes 10 seconds.
  - rscadd: Folding Barricades are resistant to acid (cannot be melted), cannot be
      jumped over (as if they had barbed wire) but do not slash back. They cannot
      be rotated or moved, they can be only undeployed and then redeployed.
  - rscadd: Folding Barricades can only be carried in hands or on the back instead
      of backpack.
  - rscadd: Folding Barricades are extremely rare.
  - rscadd: Added 4xFolding Barricade to req for 100 points.

  - tweak: 'Nerfed common marine weapons: M1911, M37, MK221, M41A MK1, M41A MK2, HPR,
      L42, M39.'
  - tweak: The MOU is now much less accurate when bursting.
  - tweak: Flechette shells have less AP now.
  - tweak: Restored Buckshot damage modifier.
  - tweak: The MOU now has a base damage penalty in exchange for its fire-rate.
2019-05-05:
  Cakey:
  - bugfix: Removed all walls under windows in Desert Dam.
  - bugfix: Fixed desert dirt being strange.
  - bugfix: Fixed tank secondary and support use hotkeys (middle mouse and ctrl-clicking
      based on active weapon).
  Fourkhan:
  - bugfix: Cryotubes now work again.
  - tweak: Cryotubes automatically eject patients after their wounds are healed.
  - tweak: Rebalanced Ravager spin slash.
  - tweak: Decreased damage by ~30%.
  - tweak: Marines targetted by spin slash will now be knocked over.
  - bugfix: Icon now correctly updates when the ability is on cooldown.
  - bugfix: LOOC now works inside the tank.
  Frans_Feiffer:
  - imageadd: High Command has authorized a new, more fitting design for the Command
      Tablet.
  John Titor:
  - wip: A number of balance changes have been made to prepare for new Xeno strains
      in the following weeks.
  - tweak: Refactored xeno health scaling. Xenos receive their largest growth in HP
      at Elder, while Ancient is now a very small increase.
  - rscadd: Moderately increased xeno health across the board, with more favor toward
      flimsier castes. Ancient lurkers are no longer weaker than ancient drones.
  - rscadd: Halved the time it takes for a ghost to occupy a buried larva. Xenos will
      obtain reinforcements from deadchat faster.
  MattAtlas, Vicacrov:
  - rscadd: Squad leaders, attention! Squad-based requisitions have been added west
      of your squad preps. It will be your (and your acting variants') job to manage
      them.
  - rscadd: These requisitions outlets have all three vendors found in cargo, however
      they have less stock overall. These numbers are not final and will change!
  - rscadd: Acting squad leaders have access to the squad requisitions rooms.
  - rscadd: All squad roles now have an attachments box (the same as WO's) in their
      vendor.
  - tweak: Flare ammo is now IFF.
  Neth:
  - rscdel: Old armor logic was killed, thrown out of the window and buried.
  - rscadd: New armor logic works as direct % damage reduction. If armor is too high
      compared to damage, further reduction is applied.
  - rscadd: Damage for a lot of guns was changed. Health and armor for both sides
      was changed. Thus there is no point in giving changelog for them... but still
      see far below.
  - rscadd: Armor hardiness is added to xenos. The longer xeno stays in combat, the
      less effective armor becomes up to the point of being completely useless. Your
      armor value is displayed to the right as a shield icon.
  - rscadd: If xeno doesn't take damage to armor for 30 seconds and is on weeds, the
      armor regeneration will start. It will take 15 minutes for crusher to go from
      0 to 100, and 5 minutes for low armored units like spitters, warriors, hivelords,
      burrowers.
  - rscadd: Smaller xenos have evasion, which basically adds accuracy required to
      hit hostiles properly. Naturally, castes that don't have armor have this characteristic.
      Evasion goes better with upgrade for those castes.
  - rscadd: If you have more than 60% hardiness you regain armor faster. For example
      crusher will recover from 60% to 100% in 3 minutes.
  - rscadd: Warding pheromones no longer give armor and damage reduction. Warding
      increases needed critical damage to die, reduces damage to armor up to 50% on
      max level.
  - rscadd: Burrowers are stronger in combat so they can be backstabbing semi-combat
      caste, but they are slow above ground.
  - rscadd: Changed how many xeno-larva spawn from latejoin marines.
  - rscadd: Queen heal and give plasma are made stronger to accomodate new HP values
      for Xeno.
  - rscadd: Xeno progression is now fixed, so every caste progresses in a same way
  - rscadd: Runners, Drones, Sentinels, Boilers, Lurkers now have no armor and can't
      get any. They pretty much don't need armor integrity and are expected to get
      by with just pure health pool.
  - rscadd: CPR can now extend defibbable time for marines if you do it no often that
      once per 10 seconds.
  - rscadd: All weapon nerfs have been removed. M41 normal ammo received big damage
      increase. Slugs have less armor penetration but slugs break armor a lot faster.
      M39 normal ammo damage buffed. Flechette buffed, buckshot back to old damage
      values but armor can make it not as good as before. Buckshot should be good
      against unarmored.
  - rscadd: Smartgun is super accurate (because it's smart), deals not very much damage
      but breaks armor fast.
  - rscadd: Sentry turrets are very accurate but suck at armor piercing. Use it against
      quick enemies and use m56 against armored targets.
  - rscadd: SMG fire rate and damage buffed.
  - rscadd: Recovery is nullified while xeno is on fire.
  - rscadd: Bipod increases rate of fire of sniper rifle by 150%
  Ranged66:
  - tweak: Gave simple mobs (carp, npc aliens etc) attack animations and fixed hunter
      spiders.
  - rscadd: The Runner caste has gained a weaker long-range vision ability for scouting
      purposes.
  - rscadd: Airlocks now get damaged by projectiles and gained special effects upon
      being destroyed.
  Slywater:
  - bugfix: Fixed more wall-windows on Trijent.
  - bugfix: Fixed Eastern power on Trijent.
  - tweak: CPR can now prevent suffocation.

  - bugfix: Fixed railgun losing zoom upon upgrading.
  - bugfix: Removed the ping message.
  - bugfix: Fixed commander medals not being as long as they used to be.
  - bugfix: Fixed resin structures not showing proper name in textlog and made hivelord
      structures show 'thick' for appropriate structures.
  - bugfix: 'Fixed tank middle and ctrl click not working. Note: it is not cyclic.
      Order of hardpoints are prioritized in the following order: primary -> secondary
      -> support. This is regardless of which one is currently selected.'
  - bugfix: Repairing hardpoints should actually repair 10% of their health now.
  - bugfix: Apostrophes should appear properly in situations where they previously
      didn't.
  - bugfix: Gun overlay should properly update now.
  - bugfix: Eggsac carrier can no longer store huggers.
  Vicacrov:
  - rscadd: Assigned overwatch officers now show up on the stat panel for each squad.
  - bugfix: Fixed the stat panel not updating for marines.
  - tweak: Reworked the left half of lower medical on the Almayer. The details are
      as follows.
  - tweak: Chemistry can be now manned by two personnel to help medics at the early
      game rush. Its equipment was expanded accordingly.
  - tweak: The door to the Treatment Center is now in line with the Alamo's starboard
      hatches.
  - tweak: The top-left equipment room was merged into the bottom-left one and the
      new chemistry was moved into its place.
  - tweak: Chemistry got a new vending machine called WeylandChem Plus. It only has
      chem bottles, doubled amount. They vend directly into your hand and their transfer
      amount starts out maxed.
  - tweak: Added advanced first aid kits, syringes, and syringe cases for public use.
  - tweak: Defibrillators were added to the Treatment Center so doctors are less likely
      to take them.
  - tweak: The premade cryoxadone beakers were moved to chemistry.
  - tweak: Added more rollerbeds for public use and one more welding helmet.
  - tweak: Defibrillator rechargers, vendors, and body bag boxes are now closer to
      the entrance for easier accessibility.
  monkeysfist101:
  - imageadd: Added cigarette packet inhands.
  - tweak: Modified Macho Sauce to accommodate diet drinks.
  - tweak: Reorganized most drink files and culled redundant drink reagents.
  - imageadd: Souto now has inhand sprites.
2019-05-14:
  TheDonkified:
  - rscadd: Reworked the squad distribution computer so that almost anyone can be
      assigned to a squad. The only people who cannot be assigned to a marine squad
      are untrained civilians such as doctors. You must grab the person and click
      on the squad distribution computer to "scan" them in, and make sure they're
      standing next to the computer during the squad change/assignment.
  - tweak: Self-examine is slightly more descriptive in very niche situations.
  - tweak: You gain your original speed back much faster after being healed/getting
      surgery.
  - tweak: Made 'Go to Lobby' the default option when you do not get your job. Make
      sure your prefs are set to the correct option.
  - tweak: Made the M56D mount more resistant to explosions. Damage to melee will
      remain the same.
  - tweak: The clunkiness when setting up the M56D has been reduced. You still need
      to place the mount and setup the M56D as you normally would before. However,
      once the M56D has been fully built, you don't have to keep placing the mount
      and then the M56D. Instead, mount remains attached to the M56D and you only
      have to setup it up and screwdriver M56D to set it up again at a different position.
      Sprites by Frans.
  - rscadd: M56D mount can be constructed. First you need 5 plasteel (this is excuse
      for resistance to explosions). Then 10 metal and weld. Placeholder sprites for
      now.
  - tweak: Motion detector can fit in armor slot now.
  - rscadd: Humanoid mobs can no longer hurt others when on HELP intent. This includes
      shooting and melee. If there are any situations that I missed, report on Gitlab.
  - rscadd: There is now a preference to disable NON-HELP intent actions on YOURSELF
      from going through. For example, if you keep PBing and you accidentally hit
      yourself during screenshake.
  - tweak: Medic and engi vendors allow you to pick a vest instead of being constrained
      to webbing. Other specialized roles will still only get default webbing.
  - rscadd: Can repair broken vendors as squad engi+. Steps are screwdriver -> wirecutter
      -> 5 cable coil -> 1 metal -> screwdriver.
  - rscadd: Engineers can deconstruct all deconstructable machines now. However, they
      can't rebuild them (MTs+ can do that though).
  - bugfix: Supply console in req can be repaired.
  - rscadd: Burrowers can rename tunnels.
  - tweak: Railgun has lower delay between shots (10 seconds instead of 15).

  - tweak: Intelligence Officers now can hack APCs and airlocks instead of being able
      to build barricades.
  - tweak: Quick Clot and Peridaxon pill dosages were lowered to 7 from 10, to avoid
      instant ODing when two people administer them simultaneously. (OD threshold
      is still 20.)
  - tweak: Epinephrine is now made of Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and yields twice as
      much as before.
  - rscadd: Pilot Officers and Synthetics can now regain control over the dropship
      by using the console - provided they can hack it for 3 minutes without dying.
  - bugfix: Folding barricades, just like any other type of barricades, cannot be
      deployed on the dropships anymore.
  - bugfix: Intelligence officers now spawn with a pair of insulated gloves.
  - tweak: MPs were given morgue, SL req, and engineering accesses.
  - tweak: Predator Young Bloods were renamed to Bloodeds.
  - tweak: Triggered trap messages in the hivemind now appear in a smaller, italicized
      font.
  - tweak: Upon evolving, the hive now gets an accurate message whether T2 or T3 slots
      are open, instead of a generalized alert.

  - rscadd: This shrapnel is mostly for flavor, it will barely damage anyone.
  - rscadd: Sufficiently powerful explosions send out bright chunks and stripes of
      shrapnel now. Does about 1 damage, so mostly for visuals!
  - tweak: Changed the welding fuel tank explosion somewhat.

      one.

  - bugfix: Xeno speed has skyrocketed since the armour update. With this update,

  - tweak: Some castes gained some extra speed than they had a month ago.
  - bugfix: Sentinels no longer drag as quickly as runners, they drag just like drones,
      lurkers, etc.

  - tweak: Acid splash changes from the dev test are reverted, but expect a more thorough

      high pain with low damage.
  - tweak: Splinted limbs are much less punishing.
  - tweak: Movement should overall be faster for marines.
  - tweak: Pain should go into effect quicker at very high damage levels so while
      you will still have a "buffer", it will not be as large.
  - tweak: The pain indicator should correctly correspond to the new change.
  Neth Iafin:
  - tweak: M-OU53's burstfire damage per pellet reduced.

      shreds armor quickly (even when it deflects). Magazines can generally be found
      alongside normal M39 AP ammo sources, but in smaller quantity.
  - tweak: The laser sight attachment now decreases wielded scatter too, and can be
      attached to the L42.

      it a more viable option.

  - rscadd: The USCM Pyrotechnician G4-1 fueltank has been added. It can be found
      in Requisitions or the Pyrotechnician Support Kit. It can hold 3 fuel tanks
      of choice, and refills standard tanks with UT-Napthal standard fuel.
  - tweak: The Pyrotechnician Support Kit has had its welderpack removed. Instead,
      it now contains the USCM Pyrotechnician G4-1 fueltank

  - tweak: The Pyrotechnician Support Kit now has an extra fuel tank and a gellied
      fuel tank.

      Gellied Napthal reaches up to 7 tiles, but doesn't burn longer than 1-3 seconds.
      It deals moderately low damage.
  - rscadd: Gellied Napthal Type A has been added. It performs identically, just at
      higher damage. Available to specialists only.
  - rscadd: The USCM Pyrotechnician Specialist kit now contains a flame tank strap
      pouch and a tank of Gellied Napalm A.
  - tweak: Every fuel type and flame thrower has had their stats adjusted. Generally,
      flames should be more dangerous to both sides.
  - rscadd: Fuel tank strap pouchs have been added. They can be found in requisitions,
      PFC vendors (15 points), and SL vendors. They can store 2 fuel tanks of choice.

      helps you in avoiding IB and Organ Damage. It will help with bone breaks in
      future but not right now.

      against xeno spit) but are terrible at everything else. Experiment but remember

      your intestines together so you get IB and Organ Damage less often
  - tweak: Masks defend your face against spit
  - tweak: Damage to armor only works after 0.2 of a second pass, so if you shoot
      flechette or something at xeno, armor only changes after all bullets connect
  - tweak: There is a mechanic with armor that if person is dealt damage much less
      than the armor, the armor has MORE effect on that attack. Now this mechanic
      also takes into account current armor integrity
  - rscadd: IB and Organ Damage uses new "armor-damage system". "Armor Integrity"
      for IB and Organ Damage is your leftover health on the limb, which means that
      the more limb is damaged the bigger chance you have to get IB or Organ Damage.
  - rscadd: IO Suit now has 4 pockets
  - tweak: Acid Spit armor penetration reduced. Acid Spit elder+ damage reduced.
  - tweak: Tank now gets a bit more damage.
