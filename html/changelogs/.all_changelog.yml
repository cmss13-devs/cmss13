      squad's prep, Tank Crew should have their gear load properly, and PMCs should
      be able to use their PMC guns.

  - bugfix: Fixed bug where barricades would sometimes fail to protect mobs on the

      and regenerate plasma as if they were on weeds even if they aren't.
  - rscadd: New Crusher Keystone Mutator - "Faster charge buildup". Crusher's charge
      will start building up 1 tile sooner and will build up a bit faster.
  - tweak: Corrupted Hive can toggle slashing permissions like a normal Hive. You
      should still listen to your human overlords though...
  - rscadd: SCPs can now be contained. As to how - it's up to the playerbase to discover!

  - rscadd: Added a few more colonist gear presets for admins - engineer, security

  - tweak: Speed has been refactored - it's no longer black magic that devs had issue
      handling for awhile.
  - tweak: Speed mutators have been refactored to multiply xeno's speed after everything
      else has been taken into consideration. Expect fastest castes to be a bit slower,
      but slowest castes to be a touch faster. Overall, xenos shouldn't break the
      speed barrier of the game anymore.
2019-02-01:
  Neth Iafin:
  - tweak: Buckshot secondary pellet spread increased so that most of shells land
      2 tiles infort of you but quickly spread.
  - tweak: Maximum and minimum buckshot damage variance has been reduced. It has less
      chance to instakill and less chance to do almost no damage.
  - tweak: No other changes were made to buckshot, so it still damages well even at
      4-5 tiles, but chance of getting hit by all 4 pellets at that range is close
      to none even with attachments.
  Triiodine:
  - bugfix: Fixed a silly with Win-door layering.
2019-02-02:

      Requisitions and Engineering Encryption Keys.
  - tweak: Bayonet sheaths are available for PFCs and at Requisitions.
  - experiment: As part of our cleanup endeavours, the "DNA" datum has been removed
      from the game. The features we were using (blood types, fingerprints, etc.)
      have been ported over, while everything extraneous was removed. At the very
      least, this should greatly simplify the Player Panel for admins.
  - rscdel: Removed a fair bit of peripheral code around DNA - cloning machines, dna
      injectors, DNA-altering and copying viruses and other things that weren't seen
      in the normal rounds in ages.

  - tweak: There is no visual hint about this process, at least yet.
  - tweak: There is a guaranteed less than 1/10th of a second delay for pulling weapon
      from slot or wielding it.
  - tweak: Stock slowdown reduced, fire delay removed. Instead a significant (akin
      to vgrip debuff / agrip buff) Wield Delay has been added, however stock's accuracy
      should make it manageable.
  - tweak: Increased bullet resistance values for most USCM armors. Less damage from
      FF should happen.
  - tweak: Same with other factions. HvH should be FUUUUN. (no it is not, yet)
  ThePiachu:
  - rscadd: As part of its ongoing inclusion initiative, the Company is proud to present
      the Third Generation Synthetic line. They have the same capabilities as their
      Second Generation counterparts, but come in more human-like skin colours meant
      to emulate various Earth ethnicities. All USCM Second Gen Synthetic have been
      upgraded to the Third Generation model (for a nominal service fee). Those wishing

      reloading cache all the time.
  - bugfix: You shouldn't be able to latejoin as a PFC without a squad anymore.
  - bugfix: Supply Drop Console is now properly access-restricted.
  Triiodine:

  - tweak: Motion detector and whistle now come with a HUD icons.
  - tweak: Burrowers now can dig tunnels in ice floors.
  - tweak: Attacking snow as xeno with any non-help intent will start clearing it.

      produce snow patches out of nowhere.
  - tweak: Xeno traps will now let you know if they've been triggered or destroyed.
  - tweak: Destroying a hugger trap now triggers it just like an acid or gas trap.
  - rscdel: As an ongoing effort to remove code we never use, a few things have been
      removed from the codebase. Syndicate, traitors, names of systems, religions,

      and moved mirrors from above toilets.
2019-02-08:
  Cakey:
  - rscadd: Added the ability to select primary landing zones. Dropship consoles have
      been added to LZ2 on all maps and will now only allow the Xenomorph Queen to
      interact with them if designated as primary LZ. The primary LZ can be selected

  - tweak: 'NEW: You can''t peek thru signal flares with obstructed roof (so either
      clear sky or glass roof). You still can fire using those flares but you have
      to go in blind or work with ground team. You still can follow the fire mission''s
      shooting path without obstruction but only after you start shooting.'
  - tweak: 'NEW: Same for offset peeking. If tile is obstructed, your screen will
      go dark and you will receive a message. You still can execute Fire Missions.'
  - tweak: 'NEW: Signal Flares has to be ON THE GROUND to work. Not in hand or in
      backpack. If you pick signal flare mid flight, Fire Mission will be aborted.'
  - tweak: Above changes made to prevent queen killing in Ovipositor and some unfair
      air raids on spawn points. These changes do not completely remove it, they just
      make so that all parts of the marine forces has to cooperate to acheive game
      turning actions, and not just PO looking into every flare and jumping from offset
      to offset.
  - imageadd: PO's can now return their dropship home at any point from a Fly-By mission
      by hitting Abort. This sets the time left to land to 10 seconds.
  - imageadd: PO's and Queen can now see how much time left to fly.
  - imageadd: Most of the round start PO equipment was removed (excluding ammo and
      few attachments). Points were refunded.
  - imageadd: Added signal flares to SL and PFC vendors. Those act as flares that
      can emit light for less time than normal flare (around 5 times less). However
      they provide constant signal (until they are snuffed out or melted) to the PO
      and can be used instead of laser.
  - imageadd: Signal Flare Packs can be bought from the Req.
  - imageadd: Laser and Laser battery are made cheaper but they hit smaller AOE. Right
      now they are PERFECT weapon for Strafing Runs but be sure to spread shots, as
      different lasers hitting same spot is sub-optimal.
  - imageadd: Installing a fuel enhancer will allow you to fly longer during Fly-By's.
  - experiment: 'Fire Mission Mode:'
  - imageadd: PO's can set up Fire Missions - basically strafing runs on the surface
      of the planet.
  - imageadd: Everyone in the radius of actual Strafing Run location are warned by
      loud sonic boom. Sonic boom has BIG radius, YOU ARE WARNED. But run and hide
      in any case.
  - imageadd: Fire Missions should be created after all of the combat equipment has
      been installed on the dropship, including ammunition.
  - imageadd: In Fire Mission editor you can set up how mission itself plays out and
      with what offsets from the center (called GIMBAL). Do note, that all gimbals
      are relative to the direction of the strafing run, so if you do a strafing run
      south, left will be on the screen's right and vice versa
  - imageadd: While preparing for the Strafing Run you can peek thru the optical scope
      and see the situation planetside, change direction of the run and offset on
      that direction. You DO NOT NEED any additional attachments to do this.
  - imageadd: You can continue peeking thru the optical scope and see how your Fire
      Mission resolves in real time. That lets you trully feel the Xeno salt... or
      in case of FF Strafing Run... oh boy.
  - imageadd: If any error happens during Fire Mission setup, watch the chat for messages.
  - imageadd: Every weapon has a delay in Fire Mission set up, so you can't fill every
      fire segment. Again, watch the chat for hints if you use incorrect cooldowns.
  - imageadd: GAU has a delay of 2. So you can do Fire-Wait-Fire.
  - imageadd: Mini-rockets has a delay of 3. So you can do Fire-Wait-Wait-Fire.
  - imageadd: Laser has a delay of 4. So you can do Fire-Wait-Wait-Wait-Fire.
  - imageadd: Big rockets have no delay but they only have one rocket.
  - imageadd: FATTY AND NAPALM ROCKETS CANNOT BE FIRED DURING CAS RUNS.
  - imageadd: Fire Mission has to have ZERO errors for it to be run-able. If Fire
      Mission stops abruptly, it's probably because it has error now (most likely
      no ammo). You have to have enough ammo for ALL of the strafing run. If you see
      numbers in yellow in the Fire Mission setup, that means you won't have enough
      ammo for SECOND strafing run. If numbers are red - you don't have enough ammo
      RIGHT NOW.
  - imageadd: Better manual will be soon. So for now some rounds will have a PO Instructor
      Character explaining it ICly.
  - imageadd: Interface sucks, but oh well, it's NanoUI.
  - imageadd: There could be some bugs with you being able to target caves, but note
      that even tho you CAN target them and WILL fire at them, nothing will happen
      and you will waste ammo.
  ThePiachu:
  - rscadd: PFCs have been given Kits. A Kit is a box that costs 45 kit points and
      will have a variety of items fitting a particular playstyle. Kits will be more
      cost effective than buying individual items from their vendor.
  - rscadd: Current PFC Kits include mini-constructor, mini-engineer, mini-medic,
      mini-pyro and mini-sniper. Those are not nearly as potent as proper Engineers,
      Medics or Specs, but fulfill a similar role with more common items.
  - rscadd: New role has been added - Synth Survivor. You can roll it independently
      of a normal Survivor, but you do need to be Whitelisted in order to play this
      role. If chosen, you start as a Gen 1 Synth on the planet surface. Normal Synthetic
      Guidelines apply. If a Synth Survivor is spawned, xenos will be compensated
      with extra smallhost spawn to balance things out.
  - rscadd: Added a Working Joe gear presets for Admins to spawn as needed.
  - tweak: 'Implemented #5371 - Gen 1 Synths will now change eye colour based on their
      intent.'
  - tweak: M41A armor piercing ammo crate now contains an entire box of AP ammo, but
      is a bit more expensive.
  - rscdel: Removed the flare pack from ASRS random drops.
  Triiodine:
  - imageadd: Added a new piece of lobby art.
  - tweak: Updated lobby art turf description, better credits associated artists.
  - bugfix: Fixed Lifesaver bag icon issues. It will appear on mobs now.
2019-02-10:
  Miraviel:
  - rscadd: Almayer. Added spare medevac stretchers to Medbay (#5530).
  - rscadd: Almayer. Added a guaranteed brown webbing to each shipside engineering
      locker, more empty pill bottles to medicine closets, and cleaned up both (#5590).
  - tweak: Almayer. Cleans up CIC Armory lockers, adds helmets and shotgun shell rigs
      (#5729).
  - maptweak: Almayer. Replaces medical research laboratories' indestructible north
      and south walls with hull ones (#4251). Containment cells are unchanged.
  - bugfix: Almayer. Removes space cameras (#5740).
  ThePiachu:
  - bugfix: Regurgitating people while in tunnel shouldn't cause a runtime error due
      to your location being null.
  - bugfix: ASRS shouldn't try giving you a null box causing the Requisition lift
      to bork.
  - bugfix: You can use tunnels even without a Queen being alive.
  - bugfix: Running a fire mission without ammo shouldn't cause a runtime error.
  Triiodine:
  - imageadd: The M42C has been visually redrawn. Wield sprites added.
  - imageadd: The M240 & M240T have been redrawn.
  - imageadd: The M46C now has suit slot and back sprites.
  - bugfix: The Type-71 and variants have had their left handed wield sprites fixed.
2019-02-11:
  Neth Iafin:
  - tweak: Most of the tweaks are directed at signal flares that were found a bit
      too much when used but at the same time rarely used.
  - tweak: Signal Flares now take time (5 seconds) before they become fully active.
      After that they can't be picked up. You can still push them with explosives,
      but why.
  - tweak: Signal Flare lifetime is now cut in half.
  - tweak: You can't use Signal Flare that was activated on a different level.
  - tweak: Dropship roofs are now metal, instead of nothing, making pilots unable
      to see the target in another dropship.
  - tweak: Prison Civ Quarters now has heavy metal roof. Pilots can't see there directly
      either.
  - tweak: Removed Signal Flares from PFCs and SLs. Added Pack of Signal Flares (5
      flares in it) to SL vendor for 15 points.
  - tweak: Added few packs of Signal Flares to 'ColMarTech automated armaments vendor'.
      Bother your local RO to get some.
  - tweak: Changed sprite of Signal Flare Pack, thanks to Triiodine. Now Sig-Flare
      Pack is called H-89S.
  - tweak: Removed 2 roundstart mini-rocket stacks that were added last week.
  - bugfix: Fixed bug that forced view to reset on ladders, cameras and CAS.
  - bugfix: Fixed lost gimbals on Dropships.
  RavingManiac:
  - rscadd: Acid spray will now reduce or extinguish fires, depending on fire intensity.
  - rscadd: Explosions will clear smoke clouds.
  - tweak: Reduced burst delay of some automatic pistols, as well as the M46C.
  - tweak: Refactored attacks on simple animals. Such attacks now have the save audio/visual
      effects as attacks on regular mobs.
  - tweak: Quintupled line-of-sight embryo incubation bonus. As before, light is not
      neccessary for it to work.
  - tweak: Scary thing made scarier.
  - tweak: Adjusted skillsets of human factions:<br>- The CLF have poor firearms training,
      but make up for it with resourcefulness, plus diverse skillsets from their civilian
      backgrounds.<br>- The Freelancers and the UPP have roughly the same training
      as the USCM, but with additional construction/engineering skills.<br>- Private
      Military Contractors have superior firearms training, as well as security and
      construction/engineering skills.
  ThePiachu:
  - tweak: Select Equipment works on non-humanoids (including observers). If used
      on a non-humanoid, it will turn them into a human first before applying a preset.
  - bugfix: Cryo ERT marines should appear in the crew manifest.
  - tweak: DEFCON's Cryo ERTs no longer announce a distress beacon, but spawn the
      same otherwise.
  - tweak: Faction information is embedded into users' ID. Antag vendors on the admin
      level refer to that ID now. Future items might refer to that ID as well rather
      than using mind's faction. Setting up mobs for an event should be easier with
      this.
  Triiodine:
  - bugfix: Changed X Y attachment location on M240 Incinerator.
2019-02-12:
  Miraviel:
  - rscadd: Prison Station. The grass is diggable now. Added a grass patch to Yard.
  - rscadd: Prison Station. Added a cautery to the surgery room (#4752) and a few
      more welding helmets around the map (#5601).
  - tweak: Prison Station. The ceiling was changed to glass everywhere, meaning that
      medevac/CAS/supply drops are available thorough the entire map.
  - tweak: Prison Station. Xeno spawnpoints were tweaked to allow more options for
      a starter hive (#1986). Survivor, monkey, and predator spawnpoints were changed
      accordingly.
  - rscdel: Prison Station. Medical and Panopticon do not connect anymore.
  - rscdel: Prison Station. Medium Security and Protective Custody do not connect
      anymore.
  - rscdel: Prison Station. Yard blast doors were removed (#5475).
  ThePiachu:
  - tweak: Old Follow verb has been restored. New Follow functionality (for right-click
      follow) is now under Follow Them. Since there is no way of creating a right-click
      verb without also creating a corresponging verb in the sidebar, it's there too
      now.
2019-02-13:
  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: The engineering and construction pamphlets have been merged into one.
  - tweak: The constructor kit no longer has plasteel that the constructors can't
      use. Instead, it has ten more metal sheets.
  - tweak: You can no longer use more than one pamphlet. Don't hog them all.
  - rscadd: 'Added a new PFC kit: the JTAC kit. It contains two packs of signal flares
      and a shiny pair of tactical binoculars. These ONLY spawn in Requisitions and
      cannot be bought at vendors.'
  - rscadd: Alongside the JTAC kits, a new frequency has been added, the JTAC frequency.
      Command radio headsets and SL headsets spawn with this by default. Squad Leaders
      also get the JTAC frequency, and the JTAC kits get its encryption key. Talk
      on it with the :j prefix.
  - tweak: Squad Marines can now select M39 holsters and buy gyroscopic stabilizers
      from their vendor.
  - experiment: The first patch of the Xeno Rebalance is here. This is an experimental
      rebalance aimed at making younger tiers viable in combat, and making latter
      tiers less overwhelmingly strong. Nothing here is final and may change.
  - tweak: Tier 1 Xenos have had their power curve lowered a little. Young Tier 1s
      are roughly equal to slightly better old Mature Tier 1s, with Ancients keeping
      their old strength - however, most of it has been trickled down to lower upgrades.
  - tweak: Tier 2 Xenos have had their power curve lowered. Elder is now the peak
      strength, lower upgrades are about slightly better old Mature levels, and Ancient
      only gives you mutator points and an extra chevron.
  - tweak: Tier 3 Xenos have also had their power curve flattened. Young Tier 3s are
      about midway from old Young to old Mature, while Matures retain full Mature
      T3 strength. Elder Tier 3s and Ancient Tier 3s now receive very slight bonuses
      to stats, and nothing major.
  - tweak: The Queen keeps its old power curve and upgrade timer.
  - tweak: Lurkers have been tweaked to do slightly less damage overall, with pounce
      delay being a little higher.
  - tweak: Upgrade and evolve timers for tier ones have been halved. The time to upgrade
      to mature for tier twos has been halved.
  - experiment: Tales tell of a new, dormant upgrade strain of Xenomorphs, surpassing
      even the old Ancients in strength...
2019-02-17:
  Deanthelis:
  - rscadd: A new autoresponse has been added.
  - tweak: The devour as xeno autoresponse has been adjusted to be accurate.
  - rscdel: Stools can no longer be used to stun things.
  MattAtlas:
  - bugfix: Chainwhip sprite fixed for real.
  - bugfix: Scout specialists should now find a JTAC encryption key in their box.
  - bugfix: Decapitated humans should no longer still have hair.
  - tweak: Greatly increased fire tick damage on Xenomorphs.
  - tweak: The M40 HEDP and M15 should now have a bigger, stronger blast radius.
  - tweak: M12 blast grenades have been slightly buffed.
  - tweak: Damage no longer randomly applies organ damage or internal bleeding. Instead,
      there's now a required amount of brute damage on the targeted area.
  - tweak: Ravager RNG delimb now requires some damage on the targeted limb before
      activating.
  - tweak: Xenomorph upgrade timers are now equal to what they were before.
  - tweak: Metal barricade health has been increased.
  - tweak: Harpoons, vox casters, the chain mesh, relay beacons, and ceremonial knives
      no longer count as Yautja gear.
  - tweak: Entrenching tools now dig up five dirt at once, at the cost of being slower.
  - rscadd: The mortar crate now comes with two JTAC encryption keys.
  - tweak: Predators should now have proper skills when they spawn.
  - tweak: Predators should now spawn with hunting pouches.
  - rscdel: Stat mutators and mutator flaws have been removed.

  - tweak: Added an extra 'You probably need to find its instructions on a paper scrap.'
      sentence to failed folder reading attempts (#5692).
  - tweak: Changed wooden barricades to be climbable and passable by thrown objects
      (#5683).
  - tweak: Changed DEFCON folders and disks to tiny objects.
  - tweak: Reduced the size of helmets and underbarrel attachments to make them fit
      into bags (#5682).
  - tweak: Reduced the time to disarm claymores to 6 seconds (#5741).
  - rscdel: Removed the 'Ring around the Rosie' lobby music (#5727).

  - tweak: GAU can now hit same tile multiple times during fire
  - bugfix: Signal Flares now actually expire
  - bugfix: CAS camera works again, HUZZAH!
  ThePiachu:
  - tweak: G1 Synthetics have been retired from the Almayer. Old G1 players can still
      spawn with them for now.
  - tweak: Synths can now repair their own damage with the appropriate tools. They
      have to do it slowly and carefully not to void their warranty.
  - tweak: Synth survivors now start with a melee weapon by default to defend themselves
      with.
  - tweak: Working Joe suit has been added to Synth Vendor.
  - tweak: Health Analyzers work on Synths now.
  - tweak: Synths should have the default large font on comms now.
2019-02-19:
  Awan:
  - tweak: Removed all ASRS explosive crates.
  - tweak: Made ASRS not spawn crates the first few minutes.
  Cakey:
  - rscdel: Savefiles with unselectable hair styles have been scrubbed.
  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: Fire tick damage has been slightly reduced.
  - bugfix: Predators should now actually have the Butcher and Claim Equipment verbs
      again.
2019-02-23:
  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: The M41A deals less damage.
  - tweak: The M39 deals less damage. M39 AP now deals less damage than normal M39
      rounds, however it gets more AP.
  - tweak: Metal barricade HP has been lowered.
  - tweak: Required damage for ravager delimb reduced.
  - tweak: Increased chance of ravager RNG delimb.
  - tweak: Reduced required damage for internal bleeding and organ damage as the threshold
      was way too high before. You still won't get instant internal bleeding from
      a few slashes however.
  - tweak: Slightly increased Elder benefits for T3s.
  - tweak: M40 HEDP grenade radius has been reduced. Explosion falloff has been reduced
      as well to compensate.
  - experimental: Xenomorph upgrade ratios have been halved once again to compensate
      for the mutator removal.
  Miraviel and Cakey:
  - maptweak: Lower medical has been remapped. Ping me (Miraviel) on Discord if you
      have any feedback!
  - maptweak: The brig has been moved to the lower deck, positioned inbetween medical
      and briefing. The lower deck has been stretched slightly to accomodate.
  - maptweak: Added a gym to the Almayer.
  - maptweak: Added a conference room to the fore of the CIC.
  - maptweak: The officer's mess has been made bigger.
  - maptweak: Added ladders connecting Astronavigation to the CIC.
  Slywater:
  - maptweak: Reworked SD in preparation for making it a distress option. Also tweaked
      it to give xenos the edge.
  - maptweak: Added more pods to lower deck (adjacent to prep).
2019-02-24:
  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: The Mini-Engineer kit now gets welding goggles and tools pouch with a welding
      tool instead of a multitool.
  - rscdel: The sentry safety option has been removed.
  - tweak: Smartgun damage has been buffed.
  - rscadd: Requisitions can now order anti-tank sniper rifle magazines for the XM42B.
  - tweak: The XM42B should no longer miss.
  - rscadd: Primordial Predaliens have been added. You'll know when one is spawned...
  ThePiachu:
  - bugfix: ASRS shouldn't be giving out infinite amount of crates anymore.
  - tweak: Ammo boxes have been re-added to Requisition vendors.
  monkeysfist101:
  - imageadd: Changed drink machines to Souto branding.
2019-02-25:
  Cakey:
  - rscadd: Added tactical nuke option when reaching DEFCON 1. The tactical nuke can
      be deployed on the colony to wipe out any living thing from the mortal realm.
      With a set timer of 5 minutes (pending change), the xenomorphs will be alerted
      of its activation, and will be shown a pinpointer to its position. The Xenomorph
      Queen can diffuse the bomb by clicking on it, and this takes 15 seconds.
  - rscadd: Tank crewmen have been re-enabled as roundstart crew. The tank vendor
      has been replaced with a tank part fabricator, which starts at 0 points. DEFCON
      rewards can grant the tank part fabricator points to build additional parts,
      and the tank only has access to the minigun turret and grenade launcher without
      this.
  - tweak: Tank crewmen now have engineering skills to repair their own tank, as well
      as better leadership skills.
  - tweak: DEFCON thresholds have been lowered overall.
  - rscadd: Added the Intelligence Officer role, for gathering DEFCON intel and point
      scores throughout the round.
  - rscadd: Added the data detector, a devide that is given to Intelligence Officers
      to detect objective items, such as intel, xeno corpses, devices, and disks.
  - tweak: DEFCON objective values have been tweaked. You now actually recieve points
      for recovering xenomorph corpses.
  - tweak: You no longer need the corresponding paper scrap to be able to interact
      with folders.
  - tweak: Folders will now display their code in their names.
  - rscadd: Added the Fulton recovery device, a 5-use item that allows you to send
      crates, unrevivable marines, dead xenomorphs, and other animals into orbit to
      be collected by the dropships. They are available from the marine vendors for
      30 points, as well as given to Intelligence officers for free.
  - rscadd: Added the Fulton recovery system, a new dropship hardpoint that can be
      used during transit (without requiring flyby). In order to use it, install the
      system and select it using the cockpit while in transit. Balloons set up by
      ground-side troops will only last 3 minutes, so pick your targets carefully!
  MattAtlas:
  - bugfix: Queens may no longer set themselves as leaders.
  Miraviel:
  - tweak: Almayer. Medical. Moved the sleeper to the bottom right corner, added another
      body scanner in its former place. Cryotubes were changed to eject patients whichever
      direction they face (west on the Almayer). Removed a cryotube for the sake of
      visuals. Might re-add it later if we really need it.
  - bugfix: Almayer. Medical. Fixed the medical-to-hangar airlock access issues, added
      a missing dropper to the chemistry. Added an access requirement to the CMO's
      personal cabinet and shutters to his office. Moved a wall sign from below a
      light tube.
  - tweak: Almayer. Brig. Isolation cell windows were made super strong. Removed an
      extra potted plant and an APC from processing. Added lights to the security
      office, shutters to the armory. Added access requirements to the shutters and
      the wall-mounted flashes. Moved the fire alarm in the main room.
  - bugfix: Almayer. Brig. Fixed the entry and the two pairs of exit shutters not
      reacting to their buttons.
  - bugfix: Almayer. Fixed the lack of lights in the conference room.
2019-02-26:
  Cakey:

  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: Slightly lowered smartgun damage to saner levels.
  - tweak: Mateba accuracy has been buffed.
  - tweak: Humans with helmets should no longer be able to be decapitated. Synths
      are unaffected by this.
  Miraviel:
  - tweak: LV. Added more larva spawnpoints. Some pre-spawned resin structures were
      changed.
  - bugfix: LV. Reinforced window frames were swapped to normal ones where the wall
      is not reinforced, so acid-users can melt in. Deleted some awkward fog parts
      (#4092). Fixed a floating APC (#4091).
2019-02-27:
  MattAtlas:
  - bugfix: Xenomorphs should no longer lose stats upon upgrading to elder/ancient.
      Oops.
  - rscadd: Added the extended barrel, suppressor and recoil compensator to the PFC
      vendor.
  - tweak: Removed the increased wield delay from the vertical grip. You just move
      a bit slower now.
  - tweak: The Chief Engineer now has squad comms and MedSci comms once again.
  - tweak: The CMP now has MedSci and Engineering comms again.
2019-03-02:
  Cakey:
  - rscadd: Re-added the ship self destruct systems.
  - rscadd: The tank now gets a smoke launcher on roundstart.
  - rscadd: You can now view all DEFCON rewards from the comms console.
  - tweak: Changed DEFCON points per level and reward costs. Point rewards per level.
  - maptweak: Added toolbelts and welding equipment to the Tanker's quarters.
  - maptweak: Reshuffled the CIC to have all seating positions visible from all seating
      positions.
  - tweak: Fulton stacks have been increased to 10.
  - tweak: Added a Fulton Recover Device crate to requisitions.
  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: Predators can now be combat hugged once again, since it was far too hard
      to infect a Predator before.
  - tweak: Spitter acid spit damage has been buffed.
  - bugfix: The plasma rifle should actually do damage now.
  - experimental: M41A, M39, M4RA and the main buckshot shell have all had their damage
      slightly lowered as an experiment.
  - tweak: Xenomorphs should now gain more health earlier in maturity.
  MattAtlas, Triiodine:
  - rscadd: The M5A6 smartpistol has been added. It can be found in Requisitions vendors.
      This pistol fires IFF AP ammunition.
  - rscadd: The M39 arm brace stock has been added. This stock makes one handing much
      better while making wielding much worse. It can be found in the Requisitions
      attachment vendor.
  - rscadd: Light and Heavy armor types have been added to the PFC marine vendors.
      As you would expect, Heavy armor protects significantly more against melee and
      bullets, while also covering feet. Light armor protects less but you run faster.
  - bugfix: PMCs should now actually have PMC IFF. That means the PMC sniper shouldn't
      hit them.
  - rscadd: The smartpistol has its own unique belt that can also be gotten from Requisitions.
  - imageadd: New PFC kit sprites courtesy of Triiodine.
  Neth Iafin:
  - rscadd: All new item sprites are made by Triiodine.
  - rscadd: Added L41A Battle Rifle.
  - rscadd: Added Heavy Support kit.
  - rscadd: Added Deployable Folding Barricades.
  - rscadd: Added IFTS Mini-Scope and Carbon Stock - Battle Rifle's unique attachments.
  - tweak: Rebalanced Marine Vendor costs. Item cost has been scaled to usefulness.
  - rscadd: 'MORE DETAILS:'
  - rscadd: L41A Battle Rifle - easy to carry, doesn't slow you down, worse accuracy
      when wielded than M41A, better accuracy (slightly) when not wielded over M41A.
      This weapon can't burstfire but can become super precise with the help of attachments.
  - rscadd: Battle Rifle uses its own magazines that use standard M41A ammo. Each
      magazine can contain up to 20 bullets, except extended mag that contains 35
      bullets. There is also AP variant with standard capacity.
  - rscadd: Battle Rifle can quickly (1 second) detach and attach its barrel attachment.
  - rscadd: 'Battle Rifle can have following attachments: suppressor, bayonet, red
      dot, flashlight, extended barrel, quickfire adapter, magnetic harness, carbon
      stock, scope, miniscope, IFTS Mini-Scope.'
  - rscadd: IFTS Mini-Scope - Unique attachment for the Battle Rifle. It allows you
      to zoom with offset akin to miniscope but has no drawbacks/benefits to accuracy
      or scatter. Scope also gives a small slowdown to movement speed while scoped
      in. Scoping in takes up to one second.
  - rscadd: IFTS Mini-Scope can be only received by taking mini-sniper kit or being
      Medic/Engineer and picking it as your free attachment.
  - rscadd: IFTS Mini-Scope has IFF but it also lowers your RoF.
  - rscadd: Carbon Stock - unique attachment for the Battle Rifle. Gives Battle Rifle
      a significant increase in accuracy while only increasing wield delay and size.
  - tweak: Mini-sniper kit now provides L41A Battle Rifle, Supressor, Extended Barrel,
      IFTS Mini-Scope, Carbon Stock, 2 Battle Rifle AP mags.
  - rscadd: Composite Deployable Folding Barricades - barricade that can be deployed
      in 3 seconds without any training. They can be repaired without skill for 40%
      of their health. If Folding Barricade took more than 40% of the damage, it's
      maximum possible health after repairs will lower.
  - rscadd: To collapse barricade, drag its deployed sprite onto yourself. Collapsing
      a barricade takes 10 seconds.
  - rscadd: Folding Barricades are resistant to acid (cannot be melted), cannot be
      jumped over (as if they had barbed wire) but do not slash back. They cannot
      be rotated or moved, they can be only undeployed and then redeployed.
  - rscadd: Folding Barricades can only be carried in hands or on the back instead
      of backpack.
  - rscadd: Folding Barricades are extremely rare.
  - rscadd: Added 4xFolding Barricade to req for 100 points.

  - tweak: 'Nerfed common marine weapons: M1911, M37, MK221, M41A MK1, M41A MK2, HPR,
      L42, M39.'
  - tweak: The MOU is now much less accurate when bursting.
  - tweak: Flechette shells have less AP now.
  - tweak: Restored Buckshot damage modifier.
  - tweak: The MOU now has a base damage penalty in exchange for its fire-rate.
2019-05-05:
  Cakey:
  - bugfix: Removed all walls under windows in Desert Dam.
  - bugfix: Fixed desert dirt being strange.
  - bugfix: Fixed tank secondary and support use hotkeys (middle mouse and ctrl-clicking
      based on active weapon).
  Fourkhan:
  - bugfix: Cryotubes now work again.
  - tweak: Cryotubes automatically eject patients after their wounds are healed.
  - tweak: Rebalanced Ravager spin slash.
  - tweak: Decreased damage by ~30%.
  - tweak: Marines targetted by spin slash will now be knocked over.
  - bugfix: Icon now correctly updates when the ability is on cooldown.
  - bugfix: LOOC now works inside the tank.
  Frans_Feiffer:
  - imageadd: High Command has authorized a new, more fitting design for the Command
      Tablet.
  John Titor:
  - wip: A number of balance changes have been made to prepare for new Xeno strains
      in the following weeks.
  - tweak: Refactored xeno health scaling. Xenos receive their largest growth in HP
      at Elder, while Ancient is now a very small increase.
  - rscadd: Moderately increased xeno health across the board, with more favor toward
      flimsier castes. Ancient lurkers are no longer weaker than ancient drones.
  - rscadd: Halved the time it takes for a ghost to occupy a buried larva. Xenos will
      obtain reinforcements from deadchat faster.
  MattAtlas, Vicacrov:
  - rscadd: Squad leaders, attention! Squad-based requisitions have been added west
      of your squad preps. It will be your (and your acting variants') job to manage
      them.
  - rscadd: These requisitions outlets have all three vendors found in cargo, however
      they have less stock overall. These numbers are not final and will change!
  - rscadd: Acting squad leaders have access to the squad requisitions rooms.
  - rscadd: All squad roles now have an attachments box (the same as WO's) in their
      vendor.
  - tweak: Flare ammo is now IFF.
  Neth:
  - rscdel: Old armor logic was killed, thrown out of the window and buried.
  - rscadd: New armor logic works as direct % damage reduction. If armor is too high
      compared to damage, further reduction is applied.
  - rscadd: Damage for a lot of guns was changed. Health and armor for both sides
      was changed. Thus there is no point in giving changelog for them... but still
      see far below.
  - rscadd: Armor hardiness is added to xenos. The longer xeno stays in combat, the
      less effective armor becomes up to the point of being completely useless. Your
      armor value is displayed to the right as a shield icon.
  - rscadd: If xeno doesn't take damage to armor for 30 seconds and is on weeds, the
      armor regeneration will start. It will take 15 minutes for crusher to go from
      0 to 100, and 5 minutes for low armored units like spitters, warriors, hivelords,
      burrowers.
  - rscadd: Smaller xenos have evasion, which basically adds accuracy required to
      hit hostiles properly. Naturally, castes that don't have armor have this characteristic.
      Evasion goes better with upgrade for those castes.
  - rscadd: If you have more than 60% hardiness you regain armor faster. For example
      crusher will recover from 60% to 100% in 3 minutes.
  - rscadd: Warding pheromones no longer give armor and damage reduction. Warding
      increases needed critical damage to die, reduces damage to armor up to 50% on
      max level.
  - rscadd: Burrowers are stronger in combat so they can be backstabbing semi-combat
      caste, but they are slow above ground.
  - rscadd: Changed how many xeno-larva spawn from latejoin marines.
  - rscadd: Queen heal and give plasma are made stronger to accomodate new HP values
      for Xeno.
  - rscadd: Xeno progression is now fixed, so every caste progresses in a same way
  - rscadd: Runners, Drones, Sentinels, Boilers, Lurkers now have no armor and can't
      get any. They pretty much don't need armor integrity and are expected to get
      by with just pure health pool.
  - rscadd: CPR can now extend defibbable time for marines if you do it no often that
      once per 10 seconds.
  - rscadd: All weapon nerfs have been removed. M41 normal ammo received big damage
      increase. Slugs have less armor penetration but slugs break armor a lot faster.
      M39 normal ammo damage buffed. Flechette buffed, buckshot back to old damage
      values but armor can make it not as good as before. Buckshot should be good
      against unarmored.
  - rscadd: Smartgun is super accurate (because it's smart), deals not very much damage
      but breaks armor fast.
  - rscadd: Sentry turrets are very accurate but suck at armor piercing. Use it against
      quick enemies and use m56 against armored targets.
  - rscadd: SMG fire rate and damage buffed.
  - rscadd: Recovery is nullified while xeno is on fire.
  - rscadd: Bipod increases rate of fire of sniper rifle by 150%
  Ranged66:
  - tweak: Gave simple mobs (carp, npc aliens etc) attack animations and fixed hunter
      spiders.
  - rscadd: The Runner caste has gained a weaker long-range vision ability for scouting
      purposes.
  - rscadd: Airlocks now get damaged by projectiles and gained special effects upon
      being destroyed.
  Slywater:
  - bugfix: Fixed more wall-windows on Trijent.
  - bugfix: Fixed Eastern power on Trijent.
  - tweak: CPR can now prevent suffocation.

  - bugfix: Fixed railgun losing zoom upon upgrading.
  - bugfix: Removed the ping message.
  - bugfix: Fixed commander medals not being as long as they used to be.
  - bugfix: Fixed resin structures not showing proper name in textlog and made hivelord
      structures show 'thick' for appropriate structures.
  - bugfix: 'Fixed tank middle and ctrl click not working. Note: it is not cyclic.
      Order of hardpoints are prioritized in the following order: primary -> secondary
      -> support. This is regardless of which one is currently selected.'
  - bugfix: Repairing hardpoints should actually repair 10% of their health now.
  - bugfix: Apostrophes should appear properly in situations where they previously
      didn't.
  - bugfix: Gun overlay should properly update now.
  - bugfix: Eggsac carrier can no longer store huggers.
  Vicacrov:
  - rscadd: Assigned overwatch officers now show up on the stat panel for each squad.
  - bugfix: Fixed the stat panel not updating for marines.
  - tweak: Reworked the left half of lower medical on the Almayer. The details are
      as follows.
  - tweak: Chemistry can be now manned by two personnel to help medics at the early
      game rush. Its equipment was expanded accordingly.
  - tweak: The door to the Treatment Center is now in line with the Alamo's starboard
      hatches.
  - tweak: The top-left equipment room was merged into the bottom-left one and the
      new chemistry was moved into its place.
  - tweak: Chemistry got a new vending machine called WeylandChem Plus. It only has
      chem bottles, doubled amount. They vend directly into your hand and their transfer
      amount starts out maxed.
  - tweak: Added advanced first aid kits, syringes, and syringe cases for public use.
  - tweak: Defibrillators were added to the Treatment Center so doctors are less likely
      to take them.
  - tweak: The premade cryoxadone beakers were moved to chemistry.
  - tweak: Added more rollerbeds for public use and one more welding helmet.
  - tweak: Defibrillator rechargers, vendors, and body bag boxes are now closer to
      the entrance for easier accessibility.
  monkeysfist101:
  - imageadd: Added cigarette packet inhands.
  - tweak: Modified Macho Sauce to accommodate diet drinks.
  - tweak: Reorganized most drink files and culled redundant drink reagents.
  - imageadd: Souto now has inhand sprites.
2019-05-14:
  TheDonkified:
  - rscadd: Reworked the squad distribution computer so that almost anyone can be
      assigned to a squad. The only people who cannot be assigned to a marine squad
      are untrained civilians such as doctors. You must grab the person and click
      on the squad distribution computer to "scan" them in, and make sure they're
      standing next to the computer during the squad change/assignment.
  - tweak: Self-examine is slightly more descriptive in very niche situations.
  - tweak: You gain your original speed back much faster after being healed/getting
      surgery.
  - tweak: Made 'Go to Lobby' the default option when you do not get your job. Make
      sure your prefs are set to the correct option.
  - tweak: Made the M56D mount more resistant to explosions. Damage to melee will
      remain the same.
  - tweak: The clunkiness when setting up the M56D has been reduced. You still need
      to place the mount and setup the M56D as you normally would before. However,
      once the M56D has been fully built, you don't have to keep placing the mount
      and then the M56D. Instead, mount remains attached to the M56D and you only
      have to setup it up and screwdriver M56D to set it up again at a different position.
      Sprites by Frans.
  - rscadd: M56D mount can be constructed. First you need 5 plasteel (this is excuse
      for resistance to explosions). Then 10 metal and weld. Placeholder sprites for
      now.
  - tweak: Motion detector can fit in armor slot now.
  - rscadd: Humanoid mobs can no longer hurt others when on HELP intent. This includes
      shooting and melee. If there are any situations that I missed, report on Gitlab.
  - rscadd: There is now a preference to disable NON-HELP intent actions on YOURSELF
      from going through. For example, if you keep PBing and you accidentally hit
      yourself during screenshake.
  - tweak: Medic and engi vendors allow you to pick a vest instead of being constrained
      to webbing. Other specialized roles will still only get default webbing.
  - rscadd: Can repair broken vendors as squad engi+. Steps are screwdriver -> wirecutter
      -> 5 cable coil -> 1 metal -> screwdriver.
  - rscadd: Engineers can deconstruct all deconstructable machines now. However, they
      can't rebuild them (MTs+ can do that though).
  - bugfix: Supply console in req can be repaired.
  - rscadd: Burrowers can rename tunnels.
  - tweak: Railgun has lower delay between shots (10 seconds instead of 15).

  - tweak: Intelligence Officers now can hack APCs and airlocks instead of being able
      to build barricades.
  - tweak: Quick Clot and Peridaxon pill dosages were lowered to 7 from 10, to avoid
      instant ODing when two people administer them simultaneously. (OD threshold
      is still 20.)
  - tweak: Epinephrine is now made of Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and yields twice as
      much as before.
  - rscadd: Pilot Officers and Synthetics can now regain control over the dropship
      by using the console - provided they can hack it for 3 minutes without dying.
  - bugfix: Folding barricades, just like any other type of barricades, cannot be
      deployed on the dropships anymore.
  - bugfix: Intelligence officers now spawn with a pair of insulated gloves.
  - tweak: MPs were given morgue, SL req, and engineering accesses.
  - tweak: Predator Young Bloods were renamed to Bloodeds.
  - tweak: Triggered trap messages in the hivemind now appear in a smaller, italicized
      font.
  - tweak: Upon evolving, the hive now gets an accurate message whether T2 or T3 slots
      are open, instead of a generalized alert.

  - rscadd: This shrapnel is mostly for flavor, it will barely damage anyone.
  - rscadd: Sufficiently powerful explosions send out bright chunks and stripes of
      shrapnel now. Does about 1 damage, so mostly for visuals!
  - tweak: Changed the welding fuel tank explosion somewhat.

      one.

  - bugfix: Xeno speed has skyrocketed since the armour update. With this update,

  - tweak: Some castes gained some extra speed than they had a month ago.
  - bugfix: Sentinels no longer drag as quickly as runners, they drag just like drones,
      lurkers, etc.

  - tweak: Acid splash changes from the dev test are reverted, but expect a more thorough

      high pain with low damage.
  - tweak: Splinted limbs are much less punishing.
  - tweak: Movement should overall be faster for marines.
  - tweak: Pain should go into effect quicker at very high damage levels so while
      you will still have a "buffer", it will not be as large.
  - tweak: The pain indicator should correctly correspond to the new change.
  Neth Iafin:
  - tweak: M-OU53's burstfire damage per pellet reduced.

      shreds armor quickly (even when it deflects). Magazines can generally be found
      alongside normal M39 AP ammo sources, but in smaller quantity.
  - tweak: The laser sight attachment now decreases wielded scatter too, and can be
      attached to the L42.

      it a more viable option.

  - rscadd: The USCM Pyrotechnician G4-1 fueltank has been added. It can be found
      in Requisitions or the Pyrotechnician Support Kit. It can hold 3 fuel tanks
      of choice, and refills standard tanks with UT-Napthal standard fuel.
  - tweak: The Pyrotechnician Support Kit has had its welderpack removed. Instead,
      it now contains the USCM Pyrotechnician G4-1 fueltank

  - tweak: The Pyrotechnician Support Kit now has an extra fuel tank and a gellied
      fuel tank.

      Gellied Napthal reaches up to 7 tiles, but doesn't burn longer than 1-3 seconds.
      It deals moderately low damage.
  - rscadd: Gellied Napthal Type A has been added. It performs identically, just at
      higher damage. Available to specialists only.
  - rscadd: The USCM Pyrotechnician Specialist kit now contains a flame tank strap
      pouch and a tank of Gellied Napalm A.
  - tweak: Every fuel type and flame thrower has had their stats adjusted. Generally,
      flames should be more dangerous to both sides.
  - rscadd: Fuel tank strap pouchs have been added. They can be found in requisitions,
      PFC vendors (15 points), and SL vendors. They can store 2 fuel tanks of choice.

  - tweak: Damage to armor only works after 0.2 of a second pass, so if you shoot
      flechette or something at xeno, armor only changes after all bullets connect
  - tweak: There is a mechanic with armor that if person is dealt damage much less
      than the armor, the armor has MORE effect on that attack. Now this mechanic
      also takes into account current armor integrity
  - rscadd: IB and Organ Damage uses new "armor-damage system". "Armor Integrity"
      for IB and Organ Damage is your leftover health on the limb, which means that
      the more limb is damaged the bigger chance you have to get IB or Organ Damage.

      Xeno into an SSD xeno body) it will gain your prefix and postfix but will retain
      old number.

      and it doesn't fit the naming convention to give them prefixes/postfixes.

      an attack in dance cancels the stat buffs but empowers the attack.'
  - rscadd: 'Damage ability: Tail attack. Has two variants, both of which can be used
      from one tile further away than a slash: impale and abduct. Impale does direct
      damage and abduct applies a stun.'

      Dance is active. Impale deals double damage and abduct activates much faster.
  - rscadd: Oppressor - Tank and AoE-oriented.
  - rscadd: 'Stats changes: Heavy armor increase in exchange for heavy movespeed and
      pheromone decrease.'
  - rscadd: 'Damage ability: Punch. This is much like warrior''s punch except that
      it deals significantly more damage.'

      that explodes into Neurotoxin. It bypasses barricades but has extremely limited
      range (5 tiles).'
  - rscadd: 'All Praetorian strains/archetypes now have a unique screech ability that
      fits their design: Base Praetorian heals nearby Xenos; Royal Guard buffs the
      damage of nearby Xenos; Dancer debuffs the accuracy of nearby marines; Oppressor
      buffs the armor of nearby Xenos.'
  - rscadd: 'Macro list for the new abilities: https://pastebin.com/GHkQgKTX'

  - tweak: Neurotoxin slows on first hit, slows even more on second, shell shocks
      on third and Knocks Down on 4th. Hits after that keep targets down as long as
      they are shell shocked.
  - tweak: If neurotoxin hits human enough times it will force sleep on them for half
      a minute. Every time neurotoxin hits human after that, it resets sleep back
      to half a minute.
  - rscadd: Acid (except boiler) can hit xenos of a different hive. Neuro included,
      however it can't Stun or KO.

  - tweak: Sentinel has new type of ammo - Neurotoxic Air Splash. It costs 50 and
      hits everyone in square 1. It also reacts and airbursts if enemy is nearby.
      It stuns for less time, so it is useful to get marines to dazed state en-masse,
      but less useful as pinning tool.
  - tweak: Queen Neurotoxin Stuns for 2 seconds now (assuming 0 Endurance marine).
  Vicacrov:
  - rscadd: The intelligence officer equipment rack now also lets you choose your

      they can hear everything around them and on the radio, to keep them in the loop
      during surgery.
  - rscadd: Paralysed patients can be operated on with a 100% success (minus the surface
      penalties, of course). Use this to your advantage with lung ruptures.
  - rscadd: Suxamorycin, being an experimental W-Y chemical, may have some... unintended
      side effects. Nothing permament, however.
  - rscadd: Suxamorycin can be made by mixing chloral hydrate, oxygen, and nitrogen.

  RavingManiac:
  - rscadd: Large explosions are now processed over multiple ticks. You will see the
      explosion effect rapidly spread from the center. Perhaps, you might outrun it.
      Perhaps.
  - rscadd: 'Hotkey mode: ALT-WASD fixes mob direction.'
  - maptweak: Crashed ship on Fiorina Orbital Penitentiary made slightly more defensible.

      bins on the Almayer have USCM types. Research and the CL office has the company
      type. You can still switch to carbon-copy by using the verb.
  - tweak: In paperformatting, you can now use [uscm] to make a USCM logo or [wy]
      for a company logo. [logo] still works so you don't have to redo all your templates.
  - experiment: CHEMICAL RESEARCH UPDATE
  - rscadd: Added a random chemical generator to CM. This can generate random chemicals
      with millions of combinations for properties, recipes, names and other stats.
  - rscadd: Every round, a specific amount of these chemicals will be generated. It
      is up to the researchers to discover these chemicals and unlock their potential.
  - rscadd: Generated chemicals can have between 1-4 properties of varying potency,
      all of which can be any combination of good and bad. Discovering these will
      require thorough testing.
  - rscadd: The recipe for all generated chemicals require 3 different components,
      and maybe an additional catalyst. The components can be anything from iron to
      souto or even plasma from an alien...
  - rscadd: Chemicals with a higher number of properties tend to require more rare
      components. These may not be something you can get normally. You'll thus have
      to either retrieve a sample of it from the colony or by using hydroponics.
  - rscadd: Mutating plants in hydroponics now has a chance to make the plant contain
      a new chemical. This can also be one of the randomly generated chemicals.
  - rscadd: An XRF Scanner has been added to Almayer research. Those trained in research
      can use this to analyze the composition of a chemical sample.
  - rscadd: Chemicals scanned by the XRF might be something it can't identify. This
      means you have to obtain a sample of this first and scan that.
  - rscadd: 'Identifying a new chemical will give DEFCON, with more points from rare
      ones. You know this when the XRF prints: Saved emission spectrum of...'
  - rscadd: 'Note: The XRF does not analyze the properties of a chemical. But will
      print any infomation it might have in its database.'
  - tweak: Updated the description of most chemicals to fit better with the XRF. Not
      like you could see the descriptions before anyway...
  - rscadd: The medical computer can now print scan records onto paper.
  - rscadd: Research notes describing the random chemicals can now be found around
      research and administrative areas around maps.
  - rscadd: Vial boxes with random chemicals can now be found in research areas around
      maps.
  - wip: The above two items have yet to be added to Trijent Dam, as the map is currently
      undergoing some major changes. But will be added at a later date.
  - tweak: Researchers now spawn with a random research note. However, this note will
      only describe one of the simple chemicals. So it is just to get you started.
  - tweak: Scientist survivors now spawn with a random vial and a research note. Unlike
      the researcher's, this can be the good stuff too.
  - rscdel: Removed plant mutations for spreading vines and temperature tolerances.
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: 'Pistol Rework Commenced. '
  - rscadd: Pistols have the same accuracy when wielded and when one-handed. Akimbo
      unaffected.
  - rscdel: Dual-wielding pistols/akimbo has been nerfed. Bullet spread has been increased
      and accuracy reduced in this mode.
  - rscdel: Extended mags for M4A3 has been removed. AP and HP mags for M4A3 made
      scarce.
  - tweak: M4A3 remains a marine pistol. It offers accuracy and pure damage, in exchange
      for capacity and armour penetration. Buffed overall.
  - tweak: Mod 88 also known as 88M4 has become one of three main marine pistols.
      It is the opposite of M4A3, so it has capacity, armour penetration and a three
      round burst.
  - tweak: M44 Revolver remains a main gun, but it has been reworked. Using a speedloader
      magazine on a revolver will make it function as a normal reload. If there are
      leftover bullets in when using the speedloader, they will be dumped on the ground.
  - tweak: 'M44 Revolver ammo has changed. Normal: high damage, a little AP. Marksman:
      medium damage, decent ap and no damage falloff. Heavy: medium damage, low AP
      and a weaker version of slug effect.'
  - tweak: VP78 has replaced Mod 88 in the Self-Defense kit, spec kits and XO belt.
      The stats have been buffed to be in line with a primary weapon. More damage,
      more AP.
  - rscadd: M44, VP78, Mod 88, Smartpistol and the Mateba have all gotten a facelift,
      courtesy of Triiodine.
  - soundadd: M44, VP78 and Mod88 have gotten new sounds, mixed by Triiodine. Give
      them some time before condemning them to the gates of hell.
  - tweak: Buffed accuracy and damage of M4A3 Custom. SOs, POs and TCs spawn with
      it.
  - tweak: Buffed damage of the smartpistol slightly.
  - rscadd: A new kit has been added "Experimental Trooper Kit". It is the new kit
      to get smartpistols and everything you could need for it. It can be found in
      main req or your squad req.
  - tweak: Vendors have been changed to accommodate the above changes.
  - rscadd: Increased the slots in the mateba belt and smartpistol belt by one.
  - tweak: Some actions can now be performed one-handed, like building cades, wiring
      cades, splinting, applying kits, placing claymores and repairing cades. The
      intended use is to use a pistol in the other hand.
  - tweak: M44 Revolver stock has been changed. It can now be folded to fit in a belt
      holster or your belt slot, but it cannot fire folded. The stats are the same.
  - bugfix: 'Holsters now care about stocks again. '
  - tweak: New pain sound added, you may recognize the voice.
  - tweak: Synthetic units can now take a bit more of a beating.

  Cakey:
  - tweak: Tail sweep and spin slash macros have been turned into toggle macros.
  - rscadd: Added the TC-4T portable telecommunications kit to the Almayer, found
      in the hangar south of the Alamo. Engineers can set this up colony-side in order
      to enable communications between the ground team and the Almayer. Requires a
      TC-4T circuit board, 2 cable coils, 2 power cells, 2 manipulators and 2 filters
      to set up. Can be damaged by xenomorphs and humans alike, and must be repaired
      using a welder.
  - maptweak: Removed all functioning telecommunications from ground-side maps. Time
      to set up some dynamic FOB spots, marines!
  Frans_Feiffer:

  - rscadd: The USCM Pyrotechnician kit now spawns with a Broiler-T back harness.
      The M240-T cannot be used without it. However, it stores all three fuel types
      at the same time. The Broiler-T can be refueled by placing incinerator unit
      tanks into it. The current tank will be swapped out for the fresh one. The active
      fuel tank/type is visible as a HUD button in upper left. Pressing it will cycle
      M240-T munition type. The M240-T can also be stored inside the Broiler-T back
      harness, but it won't work with the auto-equip.
  - tweak: The M240 and M240-T now display the loaded tank's percentage of remaining
      fuel after firing.
  Vicacrov:
  - bugfix: Fixed a floating fire alarm and the north-south hangar shutters not being
      symmetrical.

2019-09-12:
  Aceluke / Foolosopher / Cakey:
  - wip: Reworked the southern side of LV almost in its entirely, information on what
      was done is down below. It is highly suggested to take a machete or knife down
      to the colony now as you have a lot more natural flora to deal with on the colony
      in exchange for the new FoB changes which were made. To summarize, both LZ1
      and LZ2 are highly defensible now but outside their safety is a highly untamed
      jungle which can be cut or burned down. More updates will come for LV, but for
      now the main change has been added.
  - maptweak: Walled off both LZs on LV, allowing for more secure FoBs and a more
      set defense for marines with one major entry way and 2 side entrances.
  - rscadd: Added doorways and walls to the side entrances of the LZs so marines have
      some starting defences against xenos upon deployment.
  - rscadd: New mechanics for cutting down flora has been added. There are two types
      of blades which can be used. Small bladed weapons and large bladed weapons.
      Small bladed weapons, like the combat knife, can cut down small vegetation with
      one hit, while taking multiple hits to take down large vegetation in multiple
      hits. Large bladed weapons, like the machete, can still cut down all flora in
      one hit.
  - rscadd: Added bushes and grass-like flora all across LV, these can be cut down
      with a combat knife or higher bladed weapon in one hit.
  - rscadd: Added tallgrass all across LV, this can be cut down just like vines with
      a machete level bladed weapon in one hit, while taking 3 hits with a smaller
      bladed weapon.
  - tweak: Changed Vines to be able to be cut down by small bladed weapons.
  - rscadd: Fire can now burn down all types of flora. Bushes, vines, and tallgrass.
      Fire still spreads on tallgrass as it used to do.

      be burned down and not spread which would have resulted in a forest fire.
  - tweak: Changed predator/Yautja wristblades to be considered small blades, enabling
      them to cut down all types of flora added. Tallgrass, vines, and bushes.
  - tweak: Changed the pathing for several flora objects, allowing them to be able
      cut down if desired by staff.
  - maptweak: Cargo north of LZ1 has been moved and its outsides redesigned.
  - maptweak: Remodeled the engineering dome on LV, allowing for more open space for

      a lot longer if power is setup on both LV and Ice colony.
  - tweak: Very slightly increased the amount of damage a floodlight can take, it
      isn't much, but they should be able to take one more slash before breaking.
  - maptweak: More floodlights have been added to LV, allowing for almost all colony
      pathways to be lit up if turned on.
  - maptweak: Remapped a few of the nightmare creations to fit with the reworked map,
      expect some new variations for LV's nightmare modes soon.

      structures up to 13 tiles away

  - rscadd: Can repair automated closets, attachment vendor, and other similar vendors
      that were previously unrepairable.

      a chance to break and require repairs from weaker explosions, however they are
      less likely to completely get deleted unless an explosion is powerful.
  - rscadd: Creating items via metal, wood, etc will try to put it in your inactive
      hand. If there is something already in your inactive hand but it is stackable,

  - rscadd: If there are still leftovers (the new item is not the same type as the
      item in your inactive hand, there was too much of the new item, or either item

      a cone in front of the claymore

      and less medical supplies. A special injector is supplied to mini-medics, but

      called Sensor HUD. This should move it more to self-reliance than replacing
      Squad Medics.

      be heard on Almayer and only if you have access to Almayer General channel in
      your headset or you are standing near intercom.
  - rscadd: 'Added new type of announcement: ARES shipwide announcement. It works

      all humans on ship will see it. Currently only available for admins.'
  - rscadd: Added option for admins to choose which faction or hive they want to send

      level.
  - tweak: Increased number of eggs that carrier can store.
  - rscdel: Removed Eggsac Carrier Strain.
  - rscadd: Added Shaman Carrier Strain. Shamans lose all abilities besides picking
      eggs up and lose ability to carry huggers. Shamans cannot be affected by pheromones,
      no matter the level or type.
  - rscadd: 'Shamans have special abilities, all of which share following features:
      They have windup (delay before effect starts), they work proportionally to amount
      of non-Shaman xenos in radius (currently currently 3/3.5/3.75/4), they do not
      work on Shamans, they have common cooldown of 40/30/25/20 seconds (so if you
      use one ability, you can''t use others for that amount of seconds), and MOST
      IMPORTANTLY they consume an egg to cast an ability. If there is no non-Shaman
      xenos near to you, effect is cancelled but resources are used.'
  - rscadd: First Shaman ability is Adrenal Healing (100). After channeling for 2.5
      seconds, Shaman affects in radius 3 all other non-Shaman xenos of their hive
      by giving them overhealth for 30 seconds, repairing their armor, and unstunning
      them. Effect is proportional to number of xenos after channeling. No more than
      25% of armor integrity will be restored. Minimal effect is 10% for every, if
      only one other xeno was near you.
  - rscadd: Second Shaman ability is Frenzied Scream (300). After channeling for 3
      seconds, Shaman affects all xenos FROM OTHER HIVES and all humans by applying
      a 4 second (endurance may lower this time) knockdown and forcing humans to roll
      (it will extinguish fire and acid if you are lucky). The radius starts at 3
      tiles from Shaman if Shaman has 1 non-Shaman xenomorph nearby, and increases
      by 0.5 tiles per nearby xeno, up to limit of 7. This ability cannot hit same
      target more than once in 20 seconds. It also won't affect recently screeched
      by queen targets.
  - rscadd: 'Third Shaman ability is Adrenal Pheromones (300). After channeling for
      2.5 seconds Shaman starts emitting ALL pheromones with effect starting at 1
      (lowest level) when 1 non-Shaman xeno is nearby, and with 0.5 increase per xeno,
      it stops at 5 (ancient empress level). This pheromone emitting stays for 30
      seconds after which it expires. Reminder: Pheromones DO NOT WORK ON SHAMANS.'

  - bugfix: Deadchat can see predator translated text. [Hylla]
  - tweak: C4 can now only be seen from the side of the wall it was placed on. So
      it doesnt show up on the other side of the wall.
  - tweak: C4 now explodes walls/windows/doors in a 3x3 around where it was placed.
      Giving it a little more breach power.
  - bugfix: C4 will now properly delete the whole window if placed on a window, and
      not just the glass leaving a frame behind.

  - bugfix: Xenomorphs - Fixed carriers being able to drop facehuggers while they
      are in a tunnel.

  - bugfix: Added the Clown back to Sorokyne Strata.
  - bugfix: Larva that spawn in the Deep Jungle Security Outpost should no longer
      be trapped until they mature.

      navigate, or just cut past entirely.
  - maptweak: Added connecting lanes from Sorokyne Security Hall to the Northern Pass
      and Administration.
  - maptweak: Opened up the lanes leading into South LZ1. More changes to LZ1 and
      LZ2 pending.

      through the snow and ice is a much faster route.
  - maptweak: Removed a lot of in-the-way walls in the Jungle that over complicated
      pathing. Sightlines should be clearer, and defenses for Xenos more easily constructed.
  - maptweak: Spread out all the Xeno spawns on Sorokyne, hopefully this will encourage
      new hive locations. Previously all Xenos spawned in a ring in the south of the
      map.
  - maptweak: Opened up ice platforms and the base lanes in the Cryo-Thermal marshes,
      there should be more platform options, but they're not required to navigate

  - maptweak: Removed all the doors cutting the Aerodrome off from the rest of the
      map.
  - maptweak: Added a new lane into the Canteen in the South, it leads directly to
      the upper decks. The previous lane was expanded, the kitchen is smaller as a
      result.
  - maptweak: Widened the Administration back hall.
  - maptweak: Added a new lane between south Administration to the South Canteen hall,
      this connects it directly to the Aerodrome.
  - maptweak: Removed needless platforms and railings in Sorokyne Engineering lounge
      and foyer, it should be much easier to navigate.
  - maptweak: Reduced Sorokyne from 256x256 to 256x190 tiles.
  - maptweak: Snowstorms now have to wait 20 minutes between potentially happening
      instead of 4.
  - maptweak: There are about a hundred other smaller changes, which are far too numerous
      to list. Happy Xeno hunting and Marine nesting.
2020-02-14:
  Atebite and Cakey:

      familiarize yourself with how vehicles have changed
  - experiment: 'Vehicle interiors have been added:'
  - rscadd: Multitile vehicles now have mapped interiors. Interaction with the vehicle
      is done by interacting with various objects inside the vehicle
  - rscadd: Interiors typically feature a driver and a gunner seat. To drive the vehicle,
      buckle into the driver's seat. To... gun, buckle into the gunner's seat. To
      stop driving/gunning, unbuckle from the seat (i.e. by resisting)
  - rscadd: Passengers may enjoy the view by clicking on the viewports inside vehicles
  - tweak: Instead of ejecting people when the vehicle is destroyed, xenos can now
      enter the vehicle just like humans while they're on help intent, and may do
      so at any time, even when the vehicle is in working order. Vehicles can be entered
      and exited by both humans and xenos even when broken
  - rscadd: Vehicles spawn in with locked doors. When you're driving the vehicle,
      you get a verb that lets you toggle the door locks. You can enter vehicles even
      when they're locked if you have bridge, brig or crewman access
  - experiment: 'Vehicles now have momentum:'
  - rscadd: Vehicles have momentum. This means they'll start slow and pick up speed.
      Turning the vehicle makes you lose some momentum. You cannot immediately go
      in the reverse direction if you have momentum, but attempting to move in reverse
      will "brake" the vehicle and allow you to begin reversing faster
  - rscadd: If you crash while the vehicle has momentum, unbuckled mobs and unanchored
      items will be sent flying
  - experiment: 'Hardpoints now function differently:'
  - rscadd: Reloading hardpoints is now done by using the weapons loader inside the
      vehicle. To load ammo into a gun, click on the weapons loader while holding

      as before. The tank can fit 2 marines
  - rscadd: The tank's turret can now rotate independently of the rest of the tank.
      To operate the turret, buckle into the gunner's seat inside the tank
  - rscadd: The tank's turret features a gyroscopic lock, which will prevent it from
      rotating along with the vehicle
  - rscadd: The tank's turret is now a hardpoint. You can install it onto and remove
      it from the tank by using a powerloader
  - tweak: Primary and secondary hardpoints are now installed on the tank's turret,
      meaning the tank must have a turret installed in order to install primary/secondary
      hardpoints
  - tweak: Projectiles shot from the tank's primary weapon now begin traveling 1 tile
      out from the tank
  - experiment: 'APCs have been added:'

      marines inside, including the driver/gunner
  - experiment: 'The tank bay has been changed:'
  - rscadd: Instead of there being a broken tank in the vehicle bay, there's now a
      ASRS elevator which you can order one vehicle from. You can order equipment
      from the vendor after ordering a vehicle

  - experiment: 'Other miscellaneous changes:'
  - tweak: Tank Crewman has been renamed to Vehicle Crewman

  - rscadd: Explosions now have visible shockwaves
  - rscadd: Explosions are now circular-ish in shape
  - rscadd: Explosions blocked by walls may still spread around the wall in a cone-like
      shape. Be careful!
  - rscadd: Explosions will now reflect off walls (functionality was already there,
      just only happened in extremely specific circumstances)

  - rscadd: Xenomorph Hive Structures have been added to the game. Special construction
      nodes can be built by builder castes, leaders, or the queen depending on the
      desired restriction set by the queen at any time. Most structures require special
      hive weeds to be built and require Plasmagas as a construction resource, which
      can be gathered and delivered to construction nodes by builder castes.
  - rscadd: Added Plasmagas to the game. Plasmagas is a resource found on key locations
      of the map and can be gathered by both factions to give them advantages on the
      field.
  - rscadd: Added hive collectors, built by the resin construction ability when targetting
      a resource node or a tile with a resource node present. Gathers 1 resource per
      10 seconds and puts it into the hive resource pool.

      will spawn depending on events triggered during the round.
  - rscadd: Hive resource nodes will appear after the first hive core has been built,
      selecting whichever node is closest to the hive position.
  - rscadd: LZ resource nodes will appear next to whichever landing zone was picked
      by the marines at the start of the round, after the takeoff cooldown has passed.
  - rscadd: Primary resource nodes will appear in central and key positions in the
      map, and will start appearing after 25 minutes have passed. Once a primary node
      has been depleted, depending on the player population, a new primary node will
      appear closer to whichever faction has gathered the least resources.
  - rscadd: Added the ability to see resource node locations via the hive and command
      tacmaps.
  - rscadd: Added the hive core, a hive structure that acts as a centrepiece to all
      hives by growing hive weeds and stockpiling Plasmagas.
  - rscadd: Added the hive pylon, a remote structure that also grows hive weeds in
      a smaller radius as well as acting as a remote location from the hive to build
      hive structures and access the hive Plasmagas stockpile.
  - rscadd: Hive pylons and cores will strengthen celings above them by 1 to 2 levels
      if the area they encompass is already rooved. This will stop air support from
      being effective around hive locations.
  - rscadd: Added the spawn pool, a hive structure that can be fed bursted corpses
      in order to respawn a single xenomorph that was killed in action. Spawning can
      be disrupted by either killing the queen or destroying the pool.
  - rscadd: Added the egg morpher, a hive structure that can be fed bursted corpses
      in order to generate a total of 6 facehuggers (per corpse) gradually without
      the need of an egg. Also fires at intruders in a larger radius than normal eggs.
  - rscadd: Added the evolution pod, a hive structure that offers a bonus of 0.2 evolution
      per tick to all xenomorphs on weeds.
  - rscadd: Added the recovery node, a hive structure that slowly recovers oen xenomorph
      at a time when resting adjacent to it.
  - rscadd: Hives will now have a reduced rate of burrowed larvae after 25 minutes
      into the round. You will need to gain captures in order to efficiently grow
      your hive.
  - tweak: Default monkey spawns have been reduced from 25 to 5. Extra monkies from
      survivor spawns have been removed.
  - tweak: Young xenomorphs have been made significantly weaker. Later maturations
      have remained the same stat-wise.
  - rscdel: Xenomorph acid splashback no longer stacks and has a cooldown applied
      before the next splashback can occur.
  - rscdel: Multibursting has been removed.

      Insert the incident into the Brig System
  - rscadd: Brig System implemented. This handles the release of prisoners. Multiple
      reports can be inserted into and activated at the same time. The selected report
      will show up as a timer. When it is time for release, ARES will notify all MPs.

  Cakey:
  - rscadd: Marine heavy armor will now block lurker and runner pounces, which will
      instead now only root and screenshake for half the duration of the intended
      knockdown. This applies to PFC Heavy armor, M3-G4 and B18 heavy armors, as well
      as several non-marine heavy armor sets.
  - tweak: Queens will now start with 100 plasmagas when evolving.
  - tweak: Adjusted the amount of resin pylons allowed from 4 to 8.

      state with max fuel and no fuel consumption.'
  - experiment: ORDNANCE TECHNICIAN UPDATE. The Maintenance Technician is now renamed
      to Ordnance Technicnan.
  - rscadd: The Ordnance Technician (OT) keep the duties of maintaining the OB cannon
      and may perform the same duties as the old MT, but their primary active job
      is the construction of new weapons for the USCM arsenal.
  - maptweak: Moved Tank Crew quarters to the northern tank bay.
  - rscadd: Added an ordnance workshop in the area of the former tank bay. This workshop
      has everything needed to create custom explosives, although of finite quantity.
      Use your materials wisely!
  - rscadd: Added the armylathe. The armylathe is a special autolathe in the weapons
      workshop that prints weapon parts. For now this is just for custom explosives.
      MT level engineering is required to operate the armylathe.
  - rscadd: Added a demolitions simulator to the workshop. You can use this to test
      explosions.
  - rscadd: Added the demolitions scanner. This is a special reagent scanner used
      for scanning bombs and analyzing potential explosive and fire hazards. Use in
      hand to print the latest reading.
  - rscadd: You can now make custom mines, C4, mortar shells and spec rockets. Mortar
      shells and rockets need hydrogen or methane as fuel respectively.
  - tweak: Small chemnade casings can no longer be made by hand and large chemnade
      casings can no longer be made in the autolathe. Both of these must be made in
      the armylathe now.
  - tweak: Small chemnades now fit in the underslug grenade launcher.
  - tweak: MT level engineering is now required to assemble any custom explosive,
      which can generally be refered to as chembombs.
  - tweak: Chemnades can now only use timers. Custom mines can use proximity sensors.
      Custom C4 can use any of the former plus remote signal.
  - tweak: Chemical explosions and chemical fire limits are now defined by the container.
      This means that the upper limit is significantly lower for grenades than what
      it used to be, while rockets and mortars are closer to the old upper limit.
      Overall all custom explosives have an upper limit of 150-175% that of the non
      customizable equivalent.
  - tweak: Chemical explosions and chemical fire reactions can now interact with each
      other.
  - tweak: Nerfed water and potassium explosive reaction as there has been added new
      explosives.
  - experiment: Added the following new chemicals.
  - rscadd: Formaldehyde, made with 1 methane, 1 oxygen and 1 phoron. Formed in either
      a silver beaker (available in the workshop) or with silver as a catalyst. Used
      in making hexamine and paraformaldehyde.
  - rscadd: Paraformaldehyde, made with 1 formaldehyde and 1 water inside the workshop
      industry freezer. Used in making octogen.
  - rscadd: Hexamine, made with 2 ammonia and 3 formaldehyde. Used in making cyclonite

  - rscadd: Octogen (HMX), made with 1 hexamine, 1 polytrinic acid, 1 paraformaldehyde
      and 1 ammonium nitrate. This is a high strength high cost explosive.
  - rscadd: Explosive chemicals can now be either sensitive or insensitive.
  - rscadd: Sensitive explosives are potassium hydroxide (water and potassium), nitroglycerin
      and ANFO. These will spontanously explode if made in more than a certain quantity
      at a time or when ignited.
  - rscadd: Insensitive explosives are ammonium nitrate, cyclonite and octogen. These
      will only explode when ignited.
  - rscadd: Added the reactional chemical properties Oxidizing, Fueling, Flowing,
      Viscous and Explosive, which affect chemical fire and explosions.

  - tweak: Research Cells are no longer excempt from the grenade antigrief. So OTs
      don't go to research to turn them into your test lab, you aren't supposed to
      spend the whole round testing. That is why you have the demo scanner.
  - tweak: The Ordnance Technician will be restricted behind 3 hours of squad engineer
      playtime, when time restrictions are reactivated.
  - experiment: The code for almost all explosive devices were configured to be compatible
      with the above updates. If any explosive behaves oddly, please gitlab it.
  Vampmare:
  - experiment: Marine Defenses are here. This rework is intended to improve on planetside
      construction of defenses and give marines their own variant of XSS. The basic
      idea is that you build a Generator, then you gather crystals to keep it powered
      and the Generator will then power Defenses in the nearby area as long as its
      powered. Defenses are made by metal, making a base, making a module and inserting
      it into the base and welding.
  - rscadd: Added Generator, it will power Defenses in a 7x7 area around it. It is
      powered by phoron gathered by Collectors.
  - rscadd: Added Collector, this item is built from metal and when placed on phoron
      it will harvest it for any generators on the map.
  - rscadd: 'Added Tesla Coil, it will zap nearby mobs without proper ID, dazing and
      slowing them. Defenses placed one tile near it will also be zapped and turned
      off. '
  - rscadd: Added Flamer Sentry, it's normal sentry but it shoots fireballs that leave
      behind blue flames.
  - rscadd: Added Bell Tower, it will play a loud noise if an enemy moves within 1
      tile of it. It will only play the sound once for the same enemy until reset
      by new enemy running through.
  - rscadd: Added Planted Flag, it will boost nearby marines in a 5x5 radius with
      Hold order and Focus order.
  - tweak: Defense base, modules and the Generator can be crowbared to get the resources
      used back. The phoron is lost in the case of the Generator.
  - rscadd: There are now emergency phoron tanks to power Generators in the red alert
      chambers on Almayer, specifically in Engineering and in CIC.
  - tweak: Reworked the Sentry to be in line with the other Defenses.
  - tweak: Wall deconstruction is changed to weld->screwdriver->wirecutter->wrench->crowbar.
  - tweak: Barricades changed. If you are further than 4 tiles away from the barricade,
      and you're shooting from direction behind it, you will no longer hit it. So
      placing barricades every 4th tile and shooting from the back one is now possible.
  - rscadd: Added metal barricade upgrades, there are three variants you can upgrade
      your metal barricade into, you do it by clicking them with a metal stack. Each
      upgrade costs 2 metal, Biohazardous will increase its resistance against acid/burn
      damage, but decrease a small amount against brute. Reinforced will increase
      against brute, but decrease a small amount against acid/burn. Explosive will
      increase against explosive.
  - tweak: Metal cades health have been buffed slightly.
  - imageadd: Defenses and barricade upgrade sprites are done by Triiodine.
  - rscadd: Mini-engineer kit now contains a M56D fully kitted out for use. You can
      wear the M56D on your back. M56D assembling and disassembling is based on engineering
      skill.
  - tweak: The shared engineer vendor has been removed. Mortar is now only available
      from REQ. The metal and plasteel has been added to the standard engineer vendors.
      Mortar cost lowered in REQ.
  - rscadd: Jurisdictional Automated System implemented. All arrests will have to
      go through this machine. An incident report is made on this machine with the
      criminals ID. Take their ID off, click on the button in JAS with the ID in hand,
      they get added. Print the incident when done and bring it to the Brig Cells.
      Insert the incident into the Brig System
  - rscadd: Brig System implemented. This handles the release of prisoners. Multiple
      reports can be inserted into and activated at the same time. The selected report
      will show up as a timer. When it is time for release, ARES will notify all MPs.
  - rscadd: Forensic Scanner, when things are broken or hacked on Almayer they sometimes
      leave behind a set of prints. Scan them with the Forensic Scanner and insert
      the scanner in the Security Records computer. Read Fingerprint to see who did
      the crime and clear the scanner to scan new prints.
  - rscadd: Structural damage done to Almayer will now be announced for the whole
      ship. Destroying walls and windows. It is in our best interest to keep the ship
      whole.

  - tweak: Sentries will no longer shoot through smoke.
  - tweak: Removed the larva growth bonus of nested infected marines in sight of each
      other.
  - tweak: 'Scout cloak rework. It is now toggleable and lasts forever, but when cloaked
      you are unable to shoot guns. Decloaking will leave you unable to shoot for
      a short while. When cloaked you have 100% chance to evade friendly bullets.
      So friendlies are unable to shoot you. '
  - tweak: Reduced the M4RA burst-fire fire delay. Reduced the burst amount to 2.
      Increased the magazine count to 16.
  - tweak: M4RA minimum required distance is now 4 tiles instead of 6, this means
      there is only an accuracy penalty for targets within the first 4 tiles.
  - tweak: Holding the objectives/phoron nodes will now slowly grant DEFCON to marines
      and hidden points to xenos. When the hidden points reach a threshold, a XRT
      will be sent in. This is to hopefully help against stalemates. Points gain and
      so on are experimental.
  - tweak: Added four specialist kits as a DEFCON 2 reward.
  - tweak: DEFCON points and ASRS now use money to fund instead of points.
  Vicacrov:
  - rscadd: 'Medical - Operation Tables now notify doctors of the following conditions:
      patient is unconscious (surgery can be started), patient has low blood (hook
      up those IVs!), patient has a low nutrition level.'
  - rscadd: Medical - ChemMasters can now transfer pill bottles to nearby smartfridges.
2020-04-06:
  Atebite:
  - bugfix: The vehicle part fabricator is no longer acidable

  Neth:
  - rscadd: You can now pick an option to be Xenomorph after all marine options are
      unavailable. This still does not guarantee you the Xeno slot, since you will
      be only used in round start team balancing. (If you see burrowed/pooled larva
      round start - that will be you now)

  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Reduced the cost of marine collectors to 5 metal.
  - tweak: Increased M4RA armour penetration a great deal.
  - tweak: Removed tray functionality. It is now just a cosmetic item.
  - tweak: Defenses rework to be handheld/instant-deployable versions. Squad Engineers
      can pick one from their vendor at the roundstart, deploying it by using it and
      disassembling it by using a multitool on it. Their functionalities are mostly
      the same, no generator needed.
  - tweak: Bell Tower range increased to 5x5, whatever activates the sound will now
      be superslowed for 5 seconds.
  - tweak: Increased Sentry damage slightly.

      in periods from observers or when people join xenos from the lobby. Queen does
      not need to be in ovi anymore. Giving it bursted bodies will just increase stored
      larva by 1. Renamed to pooled larva.
  - tweak: Collectors and resource nodes have been removed for now. Building structures
      requires normal plasma.
2020-04-11:
  Jeser:
  - bugfix: Fixed missing verbs for Ghost and Chat preferences.
  TobiNerd:
  - bugfix: Fixed an issue with clicking signalers on top of each other. Fixed custom
      C4 not exploding correctly with signalers.
  - bugfix: Fixed chembomb fire radius modifier not multiplying by chem volume.
  - tweak: Nerfed OT rockets max power from 350 to 300 and OT mortars max power from
      430 to 360. Both of these are still higher than the standard equivalent.
  - tweak: Overhauled the falloff values of explosive chemicals. This value is now
      more important to the radius of the explosion than before.
  - tweak: Default explosive chemicals can no longer be used with the synthesis simulator.
      The explosive property must be discovered through new chemicals.
  - tweak: Reduced the max container size for OT rockets from 240 to 120.
  - tweak: Chemical explosives now calculate falloff levels based on additives to
      a base falloff, rather than doing an average.
  - tweak: Chemical explosives now have you trade between falloff and power, ANFO
      leaning towards the former and octogen leaning towards the latter. Cyclonite
      is in between.
  - tweak: Bomb casings now use a maximum total volume of containers rather than a
      maximum individual container volume. The volume cap has been decreased to make
      it harder to make all-in-one bombs, so you have to choose a balance.
  - tweak: The industry freezer will now max polymerize 3 containers at a time. Lowered
      how much paraformaldehyde is polymerized at a time in each container from 5
      to 3.

      Copper, hydrogen, lithium, methane, oxygen, phoron, phosphorus, potassium-chloride,
      salt.

  - bugfix: Fixed the demolitions scanner not scanning the warhead inside assembled
      rockets and mortars.
  - bugfix: Fixed the demolitions simulator no longer being able to create explosions
      after testing C4.
  - bugfix: C4 can no longer be placed on cades or crates, resulting in invisible
      C4.
  - tweak: C4 can no longer be placed humans that share faction.
  - tweak: If chem C4 or grenade explodes while being held by a mob or structure (walls
      are not structures), then it will now transfer full damage onto said mob or
      structure, and halve the actual explosion power.
  - tweak: Bombs with a signaler attached will now have a forced 3 second delay before
      detonating. A danger overlay will be visible for this duration.
  - tweak: 'You can now click a signaler with another signaler to copy over its code
      and frequency. #10824 Watermelon914.'
  - bugfix: Research chem names no longer end on a + or -. Apparently this was the
      reason some chems would glitch in nanoUI and become unpillable. Thanks to Alardun
      for helping discover the fix to this.
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Belts now appear empty, half-full or full spritewise.
  - tweak: Timed actions are now always visible.

2020-04-21:
  Jeser:
  - tweak: 'CTRL + Clicking target as a ghost now does one of the following actions:'
  - tweak: '- if target is yourself, you will re-enter your corpse after a confirmation;'
  - tweak: '- if target is an SSD xenomorph and all conditions are met, you will be
      transferred into xenomorph''s body after a confirmation;'
  - tweak: '- if target is a mob or a multitile vehicle, you will start following
      it;'
  - tweak: '- otherwise, you will simply jump to the tile where you clicked.'
  - tweak: Ghosts now have one unified Follow verb that allows to search by old and
      several new categories, such as vehicles, mobs by faction and by hive. Follow
      Local Mob verb is still there unchanged.
  Triiodine:
  - bugfix: Fixed the doors in LZ2 T-Comms being full of walls.
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Prespawned bursted corpses can no longer be used for spawn pool.
  - tweak: 'Sandbags no longer lose the wire after getting damaged enough. '
  - bugfix: A cloaking scout spec should now evade all shots not PBs.
  - bugfix: Flamer sentry now shoots over cades.
  - bugfix: Everyone can wire metal cades again.
2020-04-22:
  Jeser:
  - bugfix: Fixed bug with manual facehugging not being interrupted by moving host
      away. [Kendrick Lyon]
  Neth:
  - tweak: Removed default round start buff to upgrade and evolution for xenos
  - tweak: Evolution and Upgrade speed is now tied to number of xenos (more xenos,
      less upgrade), marines (more marines, more upgrade) and time (more time, more
      upgrade). To top it off, it is all finally related to number of Larva. If you
      have no larva, this bonus is not applied. The more larva you have, the proportionally
      more upgrade speed you will have. These effects are active only when queen is
      in ovipositor or first few minutes of the round.
  - tweak: Example, 100 marines, 10 xenos and 30 larva. Boost is 6.5x for the first
      ten minutes then it goes to 13x if NO XENOS JOIN after 40 minutes. If xenos
      keep joining as larva numbers lower, it will taper down, it will be about 1x
      when there are no larva left.
  - tweak: Returned basic increase for first 30 minutes for upgrade level and evolution.
      Now it's a maximum of two systems, whatever is bigger will be applied.
  - tweak: Xenos can now see their Evilution Boost level
  - tweak: Humans that are running AND without suit armor (that is actually an armor
      and not a santa suit) can now be neuroed in one hit. This applies to all neuro
      shots.
  - tweak: Added small slowdown to CLF hauberks so they cannot be abused.
  TobiNerd:
  - rscadd: Added a delivery chute in the OT workshop and research lobby that transports
      items to the requisitions.
  - rscadd: 'Added the Automated Chemical Integrated Delivery harness (A.C.I.D.).
      This special vest is will progressively scan its wearer for specific health
      issues and injecting its medicine when the conditions are met. Additionally
      it will also report the overall health to the wearer. Inspiration from #8988
      by Alardun.'
  - rscadd: The A.C.I.D. harness inject conditions can be configured by using a multitool/security
      access tuner on the vest.
  - rscadd: Research will start with two A.C.I.D. harnesses. More can be assembled
      by using a wirecutter on a webbing vest containing one healthanalyzer, radio,
      cable coil, hypospray and a battery.
  - rscadd: Added a new type of randomly spawned research note, research grants. Scanning
      these at the research data terminal will reward research credits.
  - rscadd: 'Added the chemical properties excreting, hypometabolizing, hypermetabolizing,
      sedative. Inspiration from #8970 by Watermelon914.'
  - rscadd: 'Added 10 rare chemical properties. One rare property will now spawn in
      clearance level 3 and 4 chemicals at a 30% and 100% rate respectively, to make
      them extra special. Inspiration from #8914 by Watermelon914.'
  - tweak: Hyposprays now have an internal vial that it uses as a magazine. This can
      be ejected after unlocking the hypospray with a screwdriver. You can still fill
      the hypospray directly if it has a vial in it, which will technically just transfer
      to the vial instead.
  - tweak: You can now add autoinjectors to vial boxes. The research centrifuge can
      now be used to fill autoinjectors. Boxes of empty autoinjectors has been added
      to research.
  - tweak: The research centrifuge will now only fill everything in the centrifuge
      uniquely if the input container has more than one chemical. Otherwise it will
      try to fill everything up.
  - tweak: 'Russian Red can no longer be a chemical component. Reported by Jaio Acex,
      #10603.'
  - tweak: Made the bonemending property more reliable.
  - tweak: The trigger thresholds for mixing explosive and hyperthermic research chemicals
      is now determined by the OD threshold.
  - tweak: Added an alert window to the research data terminal clearance brokerage
      function to reduce accidental purchases.

  - rscadd: 'Berserker Passive: Bloodrage. You gain a stack of rage whenever you slash.
      Each stack of rage increases your armor, movement speed, and attack speed. Rage
      decays while out of combat. When you reach max rage, you are ''locked'' at max
      rage for 10 seconds.'
  - rscadd: 'Berserker Ability #1: Apprehend. Pick a human target. If you are still
      within 6 tiles of them after 1 second, pull yourself to them.'
  - tweak: This pull does not allow you to bypass wired barricades and other dense
      objects (no noclipping).

      to 2 tiles.
  - rscadd: 'Hedgehog Ravager stat changes relative to base Ravager: Decreased movespeed,
      increased armor, decreased health.'
  - rscadd: 'Hedgehog Ravager Passive: Bone Shards. Your abilities now cost shards
      instead of plasma to use. For each 50 shards you have stored, gain 3 additional
      armor up to a maximum of 300 shards and 18 bonus armor. You gain shards upon
      taking damage and over time.'
  - rscadd: 'Hedgehog Ravager Ability #1: Shard Shield. Expend 200 shards to gain
      a temporary shield. Whenever the shield is damaged, spray bone shards around
      you in a 3x3 AoE centered on yourself.'

      damage, increased health, increased explosive armor.'
  - rscadd: 'Base Praetorian Passive: Corrosive Acid. Your acid-based abilities apply

      of combat.'
  - rscadd: 'Vanguard Praetorian Ability #1: Pierce. You use your tail to pierce enemies
      in a 1x3 line in front of you. If you hit at least 2 enemies, your shield is
      instantly recharged.'
  - rscadd: 'Vanguard Praetorian Ability #2: Dash. Charge through enemies to travel
      at most 4 tiles. You can reactivate the ability immediately after dashing to
      damage targets in a 3x3 grid around you. This also recharges your shield if
      it hits at least 2 targets.'
  - rscadd: 'Vanguard Praetorian Ability #3: Cleave. 2 usable options. If your shield

      lower damage.'
  - rscadd: 'Dancer Praetorian Passive: Finesse. For a short time after slashing a
      marine, you have increased evasion. Hitting a marine with a slash applies a
      tag used by your other abilities. Missing a click with your offensive abilities
      adds a short cooldown.'
  - rscadd: 'Dancer Praetorian Active #1: Impale. Attack a marine with your tail.

      targets directly under you additionally take heavy damage.'
  - rscadd: 'Crusher Active #3: Master of Defense. Gain a temporary shield that blocks

  - tweak: Changed how DEFCON percentage display level is calculated in View Objectives
      Clues and other places. It will be calculated as a ratio of total points gathered

      done.

      after death.
  - tweak: Objectives now have a guaranteed minimal amount of clues generated. Folders

      alive and they will be worth more points than corpses!
  - tweak: Yautja now also count for containment and corpse retrieval. Happy hunting!
  - tweak: On the flip side, the research containment will now open if the related

  Awantje:
  - tweak: removes hpc damage
  - tweak: Lets hpc be targeted instead of being max range always
  Neth:
  - tweak: Added new ability to Shaman Carrier "Remember Pain(300)". This lets you
      remember amount of xenos near you (non-shaman, expends egg). When you use any
      other ability, if amount of xenos around you is less than amount you remembered,
      you will cast your next ability at remembered power and reset the remembered
      count.
  ThePiachu:
  - tweak: 1st generation synths have been sped up to their later gen counterparts.
  - tweak: Synth self-repair has been sped up.
  - tweak: Changed DEFCON trigger levels to absolute numbers, rather than percentages.
      This means you shouldn't see DEFCON percentages go down unless you are really
      sabotaging yourself. This should also make maps with a lot of civilian corpses
      less of a grind.
  - tweak: Survivors are worth less intel points now.
  - tweak: Xeno containment and corpses are worth different amount of points based
      on their tier. T1 is worth less than before, T3 is worth more, etc.
  - tweak: Intel scanner now points out data terminals. This will help you locate
      them in unfamiliar maps.
  - rscadd: Added a new skill to the game - Reading and Comprehension. It's a skill
      that speeds up processing intel. IOs and all other officers have this skill
      at an advanced level, cutting down their intel processing time by 25%. There
      is also an expert level of this skill (which will be available to IOs at a later
      date once vendor changes come in) to cut down the processing time by 50%.
  - tweak: Mini Intel kits come with a basic reading pamphlet to bring the reader
      to the level of an IO.

  - tweak: Added objective landmarks to Sorokyne Strata.
  - tweak: Upped the DEFCON level requirements for LV.
  - rscadd: When fultoned objects drop to the ground they create a new objective -
      retrieve lost fulton. It is worth zero points, but it's a useful way for IOs
      to track lost intel crates.
  - tweak: When the nuclear bomb is turned off, its timer resets to full - Marines
      have to commit to detonating it and not hold the enemies hostage at 30 seconds
      pause.
  - rscadd: Added a command lockout to the bomb. If engaged by the command staff (anyone
      with Bridge access), it makes it so only command staff can toggle safety and
      toggle the timer. This is to limit potential griefing with the bomb timer.
  - tweak: Egg Morpher can now store 12 huggers. Each corpse still produces 6 huggers.
  - tweak: When Egg Morpher is destroyed it spawns some of its huggers around itself,
      like a dying Carrier.
  - tweak: Survivor synthetic now has access to Research by default (since they are
      WY property, and to help on CORSAT access)

  - bugfix: Fixed MPs not being able to use some MP lockers.
  - tweak: Intel scanners can now detect detatched synth heads.
  - tweak: Crypod logs now list an area name rather than floor name.
  - tweak: Solaris Ridge DEFCON level triggers have been made harder to complete.
  - tweak: Reduced the amount of unnecessary processing for idle airlocks, disposal
      units and computers. This should hopefully have some positive effect on lag,
      especially on large station maps.
  - bugfix: Fixed double inits of carpets, some other floors and paralysis pen.
  - bugfix: Hopefully fixed some other null runtime error.
  - rscadd: Added Triiodine's sprite to the reading pamphlet.
  - tweak: Vials get a small pixel offset.
  TobiNerd:
  - rscadd: Research can now transmit chemical data to the central WY database. This
      will make that chem exist in the following round, although with a new recipe,
      name and clearance level. The new clearance level and transmisison cost is based
      off the properties of the chem, whereas negative and neutral properties lower
      the cost.
  - rscadd: The CL can now print research grants containing 4 research credits for
      30 briefcase points.
  - rscadd: The CL can now print a chemical report for a new unique chemical at the
      cost of 50 briefcase points. The level of this chemical will be equal to the
      current clearance level of the research department.
  - rscadd: Research can now purchase chemical reports from the research terminal
      for research credits. Higher level reports can be purchased at increased price

  - tweak: The CMO now spawns with a level 2 chemical report in their labcoat.
  - tweak: All papers can now be added to the research database by clicking a research
      terminal with the paper. This means you can make your own hand-written publications!
  - tweak: You can now read papers from the research database without printing them.
  - tweak: Doubled the strength of the painkilling chemical property. Standard painkillers
      have had their property levels adjusted accordingly.
  - tweak: 'Cryometabolizing now acts as a booster to other properties for half its
      own level. The levels of other properties in cryoxadone and clonexadone have
      been lowered to represent the same healing result with the boost. #11636 by
      Watermelon914.'
  - tweak: Research now starts with 2 credits instead of 1.
  - maptweak: Added a filing cabinet to the CMO office.
  - bugfix: Fixed hyposprays that spawn empty not having a vial inside.
  - bugfix: You can no longer target chems with no recipe in the synthesis simulator,
      such as elementary particles.
  - bugfix: Fixed chem transmitted to the next round not loading properties correctly.
  - tweak: Research chem transmission cost is now minimum 3 credits. WY won't buy
      your garbage anymore.
  Triiodine:
  - bugfix: Fixed M39 brace offset issues.
  - rscdel: 'You can no longer wear health analyzers, magazines, grenades, ammunition
      handfuls, and binoculars on M3 pattern armor suit slots. Unfortunately there''s
      no clean way to change the storage priority for just these items. #8735, #9349.'

      landmarks.
  - bugfix: Fixed the M44 Custom having worse one handed accuracy, when it should've
      had superior accuracy.
  - maptweak: Removed access to the not-so-secret developer credits room on Sorokyne.
      You can still ghost over and look at it though.
  - bugfix: Fixed the cold water tile blocker that wasn't actually over cold water
      on Sorokyne.
  - bugfix: You can no longer tunnel into the dev credits room on Sorokyne.
  - bugfix: Expanded the tunnel restriction zone down by Glubs on Sorokyne.
  - bugfix: Added the missing door_open icon state for Strata specific doors.

      bars, packaged burgers, burritos, Kepler Crisps and Chunk Boxes.
  - rscadd: Added more coco to Boonie Bars, Barcadine Bars, and Chunk Boxes.
  - rscadd: Directed some of the salt from Dchat into Kepler Crisps, which now contain
      12u per tube of chips.
  - spellcheck: Renamed EAT bars to MEAT bars, as per canon appearance.
  - rscadd: You can now bash magazines against your helmet to check how many rounds
      are in them. You know, in case you go blind or something and can't use the examine
      verb.
  thepiachu:
  - rscdel: Removed some unused closets from the codebase.
  - tweak: Tweaked how some paper objectives display their messages when they are
      not active.
2020-06-22:
  Awan:

  - bugfix: Closing the window to pm a player as a mentor no longer closes the mentorhelp.
  - tweak: Fixes being able to catch throwable combi sticks.
  Cakey:
  - rscadd: Added the underbarrel fire extinguisher. Carries the same amount as a
      mini extinguisher, and can be attached to most weapons.
  - rscadd: Flamethrower spec's flamer will now spawn with a default attached UB extinguisher.
  Fourkhan:
  - tweak: 'Buffed: Trapper Boiler, Base Boiler, Base Ravager, Berserker Ravager,
      Oppressor Praetorian, Vanguard Praetorian, M41 Pulse Rifle'
  - tweak: 'Nerfed: Warden Prae, Crusher, Hedgehog Ravager, Warrior.'
  - tweak: Removed Materials Crates (metal and plasteel) from ASRS.
  - tweak: 'Details:'
  - tweak: Warrior grab is no longer a neck grab mechanically (no more oxyloss).
  - tweak: Changed the grab escape code to escape 50% of the time instead of being
      dependent on grab level.
  - tweak: Changed the damage ratio of trapper boiler's acid mine on barricades from
      0.7* total damage to 1.0* total damage.
  - tweak: Increased the damage of trapper boiler's landmine from 50 to 60.
  - tweak: Increased Boiler's view range when zoomed out by 1 tile.
  - tweak: Slightly decreased Crusher's speed at higher maturities.
  - tweak: Increased the bonus damage base ravager recieves from shields from 5% to
      10% of shield HP.
  - tweak: Increased the cooldown of Crusher's shield by 4 seconds at all maturities.
  - tweak: Increased the cooldown of Crusher's charge by 6 seconds at all maturities.
  - tweak: Decreased the damage reduction of Crusher's shield from 12.5 to 10.
  - tweak: Decreased the duration of Crusher's stomp slow from 3 seconds to 1.5 seconds.
  - tweak: Slashing targets as a crusher now decreases your cooldowns by 1 second;
      cleaving a target decreases your cooldowns by .5 seconds.

      total slash to 0.60 of total slash.
  - tweak: Increased Berserker Ravager's armor by 5.
  - tweak: Decreased the self heal of Berserker's clothesline from 200 -> 150.

      will now heal for (50+5*rage)% of their slash damage whenever they slash a human.
  - tweak: Increased the internal hitpoint gain from hitting a target with a spit
      from 40 to 75 for Warden Praetorian.
  - tweak: Decreased the passive internal hitpoint gain of Warden Praetorian from
      10 to 5.
  - tweak: Oppressor Praetorian's stomp ability now roots marines for 1.5 seconds
      in addition to stunning them.
  - tweak: Added a brief stun to Oppressor Praetorian's tail lash ability; additionally,
      it now slows hit targets for 2 seconds.

  - tweak: Increased the damage of Vanguard Praetorian's pierce ability 50 -> 60
  - tweak: Decreased the cooldown for Vanguard Praetorian's piece ability from 10s
      constant, it now starts at 4.5 seconds and decreases by .5 seconds every maturity

      instantly.
  - tweak: Removed Warden Praetorian's extra armor.
  - tweak: Removed Hedgehog Ravager's extra armor.
  - tweak: Removed the mechanic where Hedgehog Ravager could heal by reactivating

  - tweak: Upgrade rate and Evolution rate are now the same number.
  - tweak: Xenos start at 3 Evolution rate for the first 10 minutes of the game.

  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where Vanguard was immune to explosive damage after it regenerated
      it's shield twice.
  Jeser:
  - tweak: Clicking alive xenomorphs with empty hand on GRAB intent as a human won't
      result in attempt to grab xenomorph and getting stunned. Yautja and Synths are
      unchanged. CTRL + Clicking is unchanged.
  - tweak: Clicking yourself with empty hand on DISARM or GRAB intents as a human
      will check yourself for injuries now.
  - tweak: Point Blanks trigger only on HARM intent now.
  TheDonkified:
  - tweak: Middle mouse click will now allow you to give items to other humans as
      a human.
  - tweak: Middle mouse click will now allow you to climb climbable structures (window
      frames, tables, etc).
  - tweak: MMB hand swapping is still in, just don't click on a human or structure
      object that is right next to you. Xenos that use MMB for abilities will be able
      to use MMB climbing as long as you do not have an ability toggled on.
  - tweak: Added a pref for automatic punctuation.
  ThePiachu:
  - tweak: Overhauled internal logic of how power is handled.
  - rscadd: Added a garbage collector to the game. It's basically a background process
      that will periodically delete junk items from the game to hopefully lower late
      game lag. The items removed shouldn't affect the gameplay - burnt out flares,
      empty boxes, spent casings, literal garbage, etc. It won't remove items from
      your inventory in case you want to hold onto something specifically, and it
      won't instantly delete newly created garbage.
  - rscadd: Added boxes of MREs and flares, so that Requisitions won't have to send
      them down in backpacks. Sprites by Triiodine.
  - tweak: Changed Requisitions crates to use those boxes instead of the loose items.
  - tweak: Changed Large Supply Crates to do the same (you can find one in Requisitions!).
  - rscdel: Removed weapon-specific skills (pistols, shotguns, SMGs, etc.) - they
      were too redundant.
  - rscdel: Removed the Survival skill - it was only used to gate one recipe - molotov
      cocktail. Now everyone can make those! Just use paper on a bottle of something
      flammable.
  - rscdel: Squished a lot of skill levels down to just a handful. They most often
      fall under "untrained / basic training (mini-kits) / trained (combat engis,
      combat medics, OTs, doctors, etc.)". Cut down on snowflake levels for singular
      roles, like Researchers being worse at surgery, or CEs being better at powerloader.
  - tweak: POs' Powerloader skill has been buffed. The only people with a mid-range
      powerloader skill are planned to be PFCs after reading a special pamphlet (not
      in a kit form, but found on colonies around powerloaders).
  - tweak: Some timers have been rebalanced based on the skill changes (like surgery).
  - tweak: Dual-wielding SMGs now has a higher scatter than before (due to removing
      snowflake SMG skill check).
  - tweak: Shipside Synths will have a new role to play in this new skill system.
      They will be more efficient at tasks with timers than even the specialised roles.
      This will mean they can prop up an entire department by themselves, so it will
      be up to the Command to apply them to the right place. Survivor Synthetics are
      not as well trained - they are only as good as a single trained individual,
      but still have the variety of skills to apply themselves anywhere.
  - tweak: The Company has recently launched a colony diversity initiative! Not only
      will the Weston-Yamada colonies not be staffed by clones, they will have actual
      names and distinct features!
  - tweak: Changed the corpse spawner system to use Select Equipment system for loading
      gear, generating names, appearances, etc. This means the generated colonists
      will appear more varied.
  - rscdel: The new USCM protocols have established that walking is now prohibited.
      All personel must either run or stand still, no inbetween! This extends to every
      person and creature in the area of operation, civilian or extraterrestrial.
      (Removed walk intent, it wasn't used anyway, now you will always be running
      and now have to worry about fat fingering walking intent and dying because of
      it).
  - bugfix: Made WO compile again.
  - tweak: Motion detectors should properly disable themselves when a mob dies, gets
      hugged, gets buckled into a nest, etc.
  - tweak: Retrieve corpses objectives should display how many points they earn you,
      not only their completion percentage.
  - rscdel: Removed some unused infrared sight from xenos (we don't use it anyway,
      it's a whole other BYOND feature).
  - bugfix: Fixed some null error around holsters.
  - tweak: Dead people's headsets disable themselves automatically. This is for performance
      reasons. The radios don't disable themselves when you get hugged or nested,
      so you can preserve that gameplay. To re-enable the headset, just open its menu,
      it will turn itself on automatically. Hopefully this will improve late-game
      performance, not having to send messages to 100+ corpses...
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Reduced gun + bayonet damage to slightly below machete level.
  Vicacrov:
  - bugfix: Fixed the hivelord's thick resin door's health. It is now actually stronger
      than a drone's door. (12052)
  - bugfix: Fixed the CMP's ID color. It's now silver as with all commissioned officers'.
      (11879)
  - bugfix: Fixed the Queen not being able to build nests. (12277)
  - tweak: The type of the two roundstart OB warheads are now random. You can start
      with 2 HEs, 2 incediaries, 2 clusters or any of their variations. The number
      of warheads did not change. (12101)
  thepiachu:
  - maptweak: CORSAT's door access has been tweaked a bit to focus more on civilian
      access. Core buttons should still work for Marines not to derail the flow of
      the map.
2020-07-04:
  Fourkhan:
  - tweak: Decreased the effect of combat stims on movement speed by half.
  - tweak: Increased Xeno roundstart evo bonus from 3 to 4.

      to 6.5 seconds (-.5 per maturity).
  - tweak: Increased the cooldown of Warrior lunge from 6 seconds (-1 per maturity)
      to 12 seconds (-1 per maturity).
  - tweak: Removed Agility from Warrior.
  - tweak: Lowered Warrior's movespeed while dragging significantly.
  - tweak: Increased Warrior's base movespeed by 0.30.
  - tweak: Agility is now unique to Boxer Warrior
  - tweak: Decreased the duration of Crusher's stomp slow by .5 seconds.
  - tweak: Decreased the duration of Crusher's slash slow by .5 seconds.
  - tweak: Increased Oppressor Praetorian's slash damage against prone targets by
      5.

      to 3/10 of a second.
  - tweak: Changed the damage of Boiler's acid smoke from 8-10 to 20.
  Neth:
  - rscadd: Added language-based above head chat. You can disable it for current mob
      by clicking on Preferences -> Silence Abovehead Chat
  TheDonkified:
  - tweak: Crusher charge no longer causes you to go over unbarbed barricades, window
      frames, etc. It will damage/destroy these things as appropriate.
  - tweak: High toss no longer has a 4 tile range limit.
  - tweak: Xenos can slash through other xenos, tables, unbarbed barricades, etc diagonally.
  - bugfix: Slashing a cade diagonal to you should actually target that cade in the
      event there is nothing obstructing you.
  - bugfix: Throwing items at resin structures should damage them now.
  ThePiachu:
  - tweak: Replaced syringe pouches with medkit pouches for WO doctors.
  - tweak: WO requisition thingies should give proper smartgun ammo instead of just
      powerpacks.
  - bugfix: WO XO uniform should not be honked anymore.
  - bugfix: WO tactical binoculars should have proper sprites now.
  - tweak: Replaced WO Smartgunner's SMG ammo pouch with a firstaid pouch.
  - tweak: WO Xeno waves have been tweaked and shouldn't delay the round.
  - bugfix: WO ERT should spawn properly on wave 7.
  - tweak: WO Xenos will stay on for a second or two after death to give a little
      bit of a visual feedback of being dead before being deleted.
  - bugfix: WO Xeno final waves will spawn properly now (and will continue spawning
      until -morale- death improves).
  - tweak: WO Synths get their cool smartpack now.
  - maptweak: WO map has been tweaked a bit - there is a second bluespace beaker in
      chemistry, CO's quarters feature their tablet and the M46C gun, there are a
      handful of cryopods in the sleeping bunks, there are some operating tables in
      Triage, as well as some synth recharge stations.
  - tweak: Simplified Tcomms logic - it won't have to bounce through tcomm structures
      to get to your ears, hopefully meaning we'll have less chat overhead. This also
      means Tcomms won't be tied to Almayer (important for WO) - if you have a relay
      tower on the surface you can communicate there, even if Almayer is down.
  - rscdel: Deleted unused communication logic from the various Tcomm machines.
  - maptweak: WO now uses the new Tcomms relay tower.
  - tweak: Tweaked some WO gear for Smartgunners, Honor Guard Squad Leader, doctors
      - they should be more prepared for the round.
  - bugfix: WO Requisition vendors should initialise properly now.
  - tweak: Reduced WO round end variance to be 1 hour 20 minutes plus a random amount
      up to a total of 1 hour 40 minutes.
  - tweak: WO Game Mode will now delete Almayer upon start of the game to remove unnecessary
      processor load. This won't impede Marines on Whiskey Outpost itself.
  - tweak: WO supply grenades will now be easier to use - they will bring up a prompt
      upon activation to pick what type of ammo you want.
  - bugfix: Fixed Souto Man's icon sprites, gun and vehicle.
  - tweak: You can now drag and drop yourself into recharge stations.
  - rscadd: Added some gear presets for Xeno Cultists - basic Cultist dressed in a
      creepy robe, Patriarch dressed in a xeno outfit, and the Midwife - a gen 1 synth
      in a xeno outfit with medical gear. These don't appear in normal rounds and
      are there just for admin events.
  - bugfix: Fixed Predalien sprites not working.
  - tweak: All basic suits can now fit some basic equipment into their HUD slot -
      a flashlight, crowbar, radio, health analyser, oxygen tank and a pen. Armour
      is unchanged and some suits can carry different things on top of the basic equipment.
      This is to make a bigger variety of clothing useful.
  - bugfix: Predator glaive should now properly apply Interference on xenos.
  - tweak: Turned some `twohanded` weapon function paths absolute.
  - tweak: SEAs now have access to MP comms by default.
  - bugfix: Xenos can now hurt Xenos from other Hives / banished Xenos. Turns out
      the bug was around trying to fetch armour for limbs that apparently Xenos don't
      have...
  - tweak: Evilution is now calculated separately for each Hive and updated in the
      UI regularly.
  - tweak: Evilution time bonus is now incremented more granularly by about 0.1 every
      3 minutes.
  - tweak: Xenos can grab all spawned corpses to use for their Egg Morphers. Useful
      for Forward Operating Hives.
  - bugfix: Spawn Pools spawn hive-appropriate larva.
  - tweak: Re-added a short timer for taking over an SSD larva to avoid some race
      conditions and people getting kicked out of larva they just occupied.
  - tweak: Added a new access class for civilians - civilian command.
  - maptweak: CORSAT access has been tweaked a bit - it won't require Corporate access,
      but use civilian command access.
  - tweak: Updated various survivor access to use some newly added access classes.
  - maptweak: CORSAT now has some Powerloader pamphlets around the Powerloader bays
      for those ungas that want to go Ripley on Queen's thorax.
  - tweak: Synth defibbing timer has been extended to give ghosts more time to get
      back into their body.
  - tweak: Defib healing amount has been made flat to that of a doctor skill.
  - tweak: Give Synth skill speed boost to some minor timers around stripping and
      putting items back onto people, tcomms assembly and repair, removing splints.
  TobiNerd:
  - experiment: Reworked the chemical property system backend. All chemicals are now
      processed using properties, not just research chems. On the frontend chemicals
      should be basically unaffected by this, but some chemicals and some properties
      have still received minor tweaks as a result of the rework for the purpose of
      standardization.
  - rscadd: Added the properties hemositic, thermostabilizing, focusing, cardiostabilizing,
      aiding, oxygenating, anticarcinogenic and ciphering. These are tied to specific
      chemicals and do do not spawn during random generation, but they can still be
      used with the simulator if so desired.
  - rscadd: Also added the property electrogenetic, a common positive type.
  - rscadd: Properties now have categories in addition to type and rarity, these are
      medicine, toxicant, stimulant, reactant, irritant, metabolite, and anomalous.
  - rscadd: Research can now obtain clearance level X access at clearance level 5
      for an additional 5 credits.
  - tweak: The synthesis simulator now displays the property type.
  - tweak: The boosting property now only affects properties that have an effect inside
      the body.
  - tweak: Many chemicals have received slightly different overdose effects as these
      are tied to the properties.
  - tweak: Overdosing on a painkiller now gives you +50% painkilling, plus the additional
      nasty overdose stuff.
  - tweak: Synthesis targeting a rare property on relation mode now cost 3 times as
      much. Changing anomalous properties costs 10 times as much.
  - tweak: Alkysine is no longer a painkiller.
  - tweak: Halved the gain from the musclestimulating property per level.
  - tweak: Having only positive properties in a chemical now increase all Synthesis
      Simulator operation costs by 1.
  - bugfix: Fixed some inconsistency in how properties were combining.
  - bugfix: 'CL setting clearance to max no longer decrease it when clearance has
      been bought #12239.'
  - bugfix: Fixed rare chemical properties spawning at the same rate as uncommon properties.
  - bugfix: Fixed epinephrine (Electrogenetic) not working.
  Triiodine:
  - fix: Fixed the L42A Battle Rifle rail attachment offsets not actually putting
      attachments on the rear sight mount (That lil protrustion off the back).
  - fix: Fixed the M46C rail attachment offsets not being set correctly.
  - spellcheck: Fixed the L42A Battle Rifle still being called the L42 Pulse Carbine
      MK1 in the requisitions vendors.
  - spellcheck: Fixed the B8 Smart Scope description referring to the L42A Battle
      rifle as the L42A Pulse Carbine.
  - spellcheck: Fixed the B8 Smart Scope description referring to the M44 Combat Revolver
      as the M44 Magnum.
  - spellcheck: Updated the B8 Smart Scope description to properly list all the firearms
      it can attach to.
  - bugfix: Fixed missing IMP backpack icons on Prison.
  - bugfix: Fixed M37 barrel attachment offsets.
  - imageadd: Replaced powerpack object icons.
  - imageadd: Replaced intelligence backpack object icons.
  - imageadd: Replaced M22 rockpack object icons.
  - spellcheck: Changed USCM intelligence officer pack to USCM lightweight expedition
      pack and rewrote their description.
  - spellcheck: Changed M22 rocket bags to USCM IMP M22 rocket bags and rewrote their
      description.
  - tweak: Buffed Sticky resin health to 45 from 36.
  - tweak: Buffed Fast resin speed up from 50% to 70%.
  - tweak: Nerfed Fast resin health from 36 to 30.
  - experiment: Resin constructions now have variable costs, instead of only 150 plasma
      for Drones and 200 plasma for Hivelords.
  - tweak: Resin doors cost 150 plasma, 175 for thick variants.
  - tweak: Resin walls cost 150 plasma, 200 for thick variants.
  - tweak: Resin membranes cost 125 plasma, 150 for thick variants.
  - tweak: Resin nests cost 125 plasma.
  - tweak: Sticky resin costs 85 plasma.
  - tweak: Fast resin costs 65 plasma.
  - tweak: Resin structures now have 20% improved explosive resistances.
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Reduced gun + bayonet damage to slightly below machete level.
  - tweak: Tweaked melee again. Weed nodes take 1 hit with machete, 2 with bayonet.
      Resin walls take 4 hits with machete, 5 with bayonet. Resin doors take 3 hits
      with both.
  Vicacrov:
  - bugfix: Fixed the hivelord's thick resin door's health. It is now actually stronger
      than a drone's door. (12052)
  - bugfix: Fixed the CMP's ID color. It's now silver as with all commissioned officers'.
      (11879)
  - bugfix: Fixed the Queen not being able to build nests. (12277)
  - tweak: The type of the two roundstart OB warheads are now random. You can start
      with 2 HEs, 2 incediaries, 2 clusters or any of their variations. The number
      of warheads did not change. (12101)
  - rscadd: The Queen can now toggle between two unnesting modes. Default - only drone
      castes can unnest. Toggled - everyone can unnest.
  - tweak: Warriors can now punch infected marines. (12358)
  - rscdel: Instruments have been removed.
  - tweak: 'The white, semi-transparent overlay induced by eye damage was replaced
      with the vision impairment (black square) effect. Currently, it''s not scaling
      with eye damage: you either have it or not. This will be probably changed in
      the future.'
  Watermelon:
  - rscdel: Resin roof will no longer block OBs
  - bugfix: Pylons now effectively block CAS/Mortars within the range that they can
      weed.
  - bugfix: Pylons will no longer leave a roof behind
  thepiachu:
  - maptweak: CORSAT's door access has been tweaked a bit to focus more on civilian
      access. Core buttons should still work for Marines not to derail the flow of
      the map.
2020-07-08:
  Frans_Feiffer:
  - rscadd: Added Gray, Green, and Tan Beanies. These can be acquired via the Marine
      gear portion of the setup character menu. Cargo beanies were made to be inline
      with the rest of the beanies.
  - rscadd: Added Gray, Green, and Tan Balaclava's. These can be acquired via the
      Marine gear portion of the character menu, and can be pulled up/down depending
      on preference.
  - imageadd: Resprited the Coif, the coif can now also be pulled up/down depending
      on preference.
  - imageadd: Resprited Blue, Green, and Purple Surgery gowns/caps.
  - rscadd: Adds Blue and Purple surgery gowns/caps to medbay lockers. (Thanks a million,
      Retrokinesis.)
  - imageadd: Cleaned up the Marine formal uniform.
  - imageadd: Cleaned up Researcher's uniform.
  - imageadd: Resprited the Chief Engineers uniform.
  - imageadd: Resprited VC/PO armor and map variants.
  - rscadd: VC/PO helms now have helmet garbs appear on the onmob sprite just like
      the standard helmet. If it fits in the standard and shows, then it works just
      the same for these helms.
  - rscadd: Added the coif to the gear select menu.
  TheDonkified:
  - tweak: No more RNG when walking over a flamethrower fire
  - tweak: Crusher charge goes over tables and racks again; if a runner can run over
      it, crusher charge will go over it
  - tweak: Flame fire goes through the front of barricades now
  - tweak: Removed armor restrictions from marine uniform
  - bugfix: 'Examining tile contents should now show the tile itself in the list '
  - bugfix: No more pounce dragging
  - bugfix: Larva can no longer bodyblock
  - bugfix: You no longer get transferred to a rolled ERT mob if you get put into
      a new mob (eg got a larva)
  - bugfix: You can no longer pick non-dropship primary LZ locations via the CIC tablet
  - bugfix: You can point at mobs right next to you again
  TobiNerd:
  - bugfix: 'Fixed Quick Clot, Peridaxon, Spaceacillin and Universal Enzyme not having
      an overdose effect (Alardun, #12758). They all now cause brute damage on overdose.'
  - tweak: Paining is now a negative chem property.
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: 'Backend for Pain has been redone. This will hopefully make it more consistent
      and easily tweakable. This may cause issues, so report any weird interactions. '
  - tweak: Removed the hardcoded softcrit, crit and hardcrit values. They now happen
      depending on pain instead of at specific damage levels. Inaprovaline still stops
      oxygen damage at crit and hardcrit.
  - tweak: Removed maturity and its affects. Xeno health and armour has been lowered
      overall, xeno damage lowered by 10%. To counteract this, marine damage has been
      lowered overall by 20%.
  - tweak: Age/maturity is now a fluff indicator of how long a xeno has survived in
      a round.
  - tweak: Queen can now have 4 leaders and loses half of the pooled larva upon death.
      It used to scale with age.
  - tweak: Robotic limbs no longer give damage reduction. This means Synthetics will
      no longer double dip on damage reduction. This may lead to them being too weak,
      open for tweaking.
  - tweak: 'Melee skill now adds 25% extra damage pr. level instead of 20%. '
  Vicacrov:
  - bugfix: Fixed ghosts being able to mess with OT equipment by setting the transfer
      amount/direction of their dispensers, from the afterlife.
  - bugfix: Fixed the G-11 Geothermal Generator's repairing instructions, appearing
      upon examination.
  - bugfix: Fixed the smoke grenade being exempt from the antigrief system. Stop smoke
      grenading briefing.
  - bugfix: Removed some unreachable intel spawns on Big Red.
  - bugfix: Skill or ID-locked containers can no longer be emptied, opened, or otherwise
      their contents removed, if you lack either of these requirements.
  Waltermeldron:
  - rscadd: Added a new gamemode called extended no spawn. In this gamemode, marines
      will not spawn at all and will not be able to latejoin. Might be useful for
      admins doing events that don't involve marines, such as XvX
  - rscadd: Added hive-specific weeds, which will slow you down if you do not match
      their hive. Hive weeds slow down a xeno a lot more than regular weeds. Weeds
      will destroy other weeds if they don't match the correct hive, unless it is
      hive weeds. Xenos no longer regenerate plasma or health when on weeds that belong
      to a different hive
  - rscadd: Added hive-specific walls, which take longer to destroy if you do not
      match their hive.
  - rscadd: Added hive-specific doors, which take longer to destroy if you do not
      match their hive. Larvae and xenos that do not match the hive cannot scuttle
      past or open the door
  - rscadd: Added hive-specific nests, sticky resin and fast resin. Any xeno can unnest
      a nest that does not belong to their hive. Sticky resin will massively slow
      down any xeno that is not of the appropriate hive. Fast resin will only affect
      xenos of the appropriate hive.
  - rscadd: Most xeno abilities will now work on hostile xenos. Stuns will not work
      on big xenos. There are some exceptions, however, such as Queen screech
  - rscadd: Burrower traps will now trigger against hostile hives
  - rscadd: Projectiles from xenos will hit hostile xenos now
  - tweak: Most objects and special structures will now properly resemble the colour
      and the name of their correct hive. This includes eggs and facehuggers
  - tweak: Resin traps can now be destroyed by xeno projectiles, provided that the
      resin trap does not belong to the xenomorph's hive
  - tweak: Eggs will show which hive they belong to upon examination
  - tweak: Eggs can only be planted on their appropriate hive weeds
  - tweak: Queen screech will now affect xenos of different hives
  - tweak: Neurotoxin will now only apply a slowdown to other xenos. No longer will
      it disable your abilities.
  - tweak: Hive-specific special structures can now only be built on their appropriate
      hive weeds.
  - tweak: Xenos now deal more damage to each other now. This also applies to XvX
      projectiles and abilities
  - bugfix: Weed nodes can no longer be planted on hive weeds.
  - bugfix: Queens can no longer overwatch and devolve/banish xenos that do not belong
      to her hive.
  - bugfix: Weeds on walls will now disappear if there is no nearby node.
2020-07-22:
  Awan:
  - tweak: Food icons have been tweaked. They used to be black-nothing-yellow-red,
      in order of hungriness. It is now nothing-yellow-red-black. Yellow is now when
      you need to eat, before getting a slowdown at red.
  - tweak: Removed overeating. It didn't do anything, just allowed you to eat a bit
      extra and lose it instantly.
  TheDonkified:
  - rscadd: Pyro now has a "Fire Shield" that makes them immune to getting burn damage
      and igniting from fire. Other sources, such as WP smoke, incen bullets, etc
      will still be able to ignite the pyro spec while the shield is active. The shield
      lasts 6 seconds with a 15 seconds cooldown.
  - rscadd: The M240T comes with a buffed underbarrel extinguisher with 500 units
      of water and the strength to extinguish xvar flames.
  - rscadd: Specialist abilities can be macro'd. For now, there are only the Specialist-Activation-One
      and Specialist-Activation-Two verbs. Specialist-Activation-One is for scout
      cloak and toggling broiler-T fuel type. Specialist-Activation-Two is for activating
      pyro fire shield. You can still macro the specific verbs for those tools, but
      these specialist ability macros are there so you do not need to keep adding
      them when a new macroable ability is added.
  - tweak: RNG mechanics related to fire damage and ignition of mobs should be removed.
      No more flamewalking (unless you're immune). Fire deals the same damage now
      (no more RNG damage or length of being set on fire). Resisting from fire puts
      out fires at a consistent amount. Values are subject to change.
  - tweak: M240T can be manually reloaded and unloaded as long as you are not wearing
      the Broiler-T back harness. Once you put on the Broiler-T and fire, it will
      automatically eject your current magazine. Behavior when wearing the Broiler-T
      (unable to manually load or unload fuel tanks) is maintained.
  - tweak: Mag harness M240T will automatically snap to your Broiler-T instead of
      your armor slot.
  - tweak: All fire extinguishers fit in the fuel tank strap pouches.
  - tweak: Xenos cannot be healed while on fire.
  - tweak: Moved spec-only verbs to their own unique tabs.
  - tweak: Extinguisher can fit in the fueltank backpack (not the one that the pyro
      spec gets, the one found in the pyro kit/req).
  - tweak: Pyro PFC kit comes with an underbarrel extinguisher.
  - bugfix: Offsets for unbarrel attachments of flamers have been properly set.
  - bugfix: Pyro and people wearing fire suits will no longer receive extra damage
      from simply standing on fire (other mobs/humans would not receive any damage,
      just get ignited).
  - bugfix: Crusher charge can go over window frames again (pending refactor)
  - bugfix: Spitter acid spray can go through mobs again
  - bugfix: Crusher can now go over tables, racks, and the retractable railing to
      req via charge
  TobiNerd:
  - tweak: ACID Harness configuration can now be viewed by anyone using a multitool,
      but the configuration can only be changed by those with medic level medicine
      skill. Research skill is still required to craft the ACID itself.
  - tweak: ACID Harness bloodloss config now triggers at less than 60% blood instead
      of 40%.
  - bugfix: Fixed the synthesis simulator renaming chemicals to Reagent.
  - bugfix: Relating properties that alter other variables in the reagent no longer
      makes those variables go into negatives. It is now reset properly (#12766 Alardun).
  - maptweak: Did a bunch of small mapping tweaks around upper medbay.
  - maptweak: Research lobby is now larger and has been merged with the test lab.
      There's now a chem station in the lobby. The old test lab is now called the
      Research Workshop.
  - maptweak: Research now has one small containment cell and two medium containment
      cells. The last two can be merged into one large cell.
  - maptweak: Did some changes to the CL office and quarters. Quarters now have a
      separate bedroom and there's now a closet connected to the office.
  - tweak: To compensate for the now large amount of chemical dispensers on the Almayer,
      chemical dispensers now use a shared energy pool depending on their network
      (ground, medbay, research, misc). The Turing is not affected by this.
  - tweak: The hypospray lock is now togglable by verb (Toggle Hypo Lock) rather than
      screwdriver.
  - rscadd: Added the medilathe to the research workshop, which can print medical
      related items. Some medical items have been removed from the autolathe.
  - imageadd: Added new science machinery sprites based off old sprites left behind
      by NicBoone, modernised and animated by TobiNerd.
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Synthetics and preds won't stutter by pain anymore.
  - tweak: Human pain thresholds increased. So you need more pain before falling into
      crit.
  - tweak: Runner speed increased. Health decreased so that one PB kills them.
  - tweak: Spitter Frenzy now makes you slightly more faster.
  - tweak: Streamlined building of airlocks, walls and reinforced walls. Examining
      airlock assembly or girders will walk you through the steps. Girder for walls
      and reinforced walls. Airlock assembly + airlock circuit to make airlock.
  - tweak: You can now build fences with metal rods. Wirecutting a fence twice will
      give you back the metal rods.
  - tweak: You can now build window frames with 10 metal.
  - tweak: Airlocks are now deconstructed by welding it, screwdriver to open panel
      and then using crowbar.
  - tweak: Tweaked pain so that it now progresses gradually. If you take a big hit,
      it doesn't jump right to hardcrit, it has to slowly go through all the pain
      tiers. Eventually reaching up at hardcrit. This work both ways, so also when
      you take painkillers. Pain tiers tweaked as well.
  - tweak: Fixed a bunch of pain bugs related to chems and organ damage.
  - tweak: Tweaked Yautja and Synthetic pain to be less punishing.
  - tweak: Fixed a bug where synth borg charger didn't repair pain.
  - tweak: Reduced the Yautja normal and heavy armour bullet resistance. Halved the
      rate Thwei heals brute and burn at.
  - tweak: 'Increased flamers burn damage slightly, rounded to nearest 5. '
  - tweak: Reduced all resin plasma costs by 30. Walls, nest and so on. Order Construction
      plasma cost reduced to 400.
  - tweak: Reduced rifle base melee value so it can't one hit resin nodes.
  - tweak: The grass on CORSAT is now weedable.
  Vicacrov:
  - tweak: Attaching a bayonet to a weapon now makes it a sharp item. (Suggestion
      12544)
  - tweak: Any sharp item can now cut vines.
  - tweak: Command headsets (CO, XO, synth) now start with all four squad channels
      turned on. (Suggestion 12890)
  - tweak: You can now use autoinjectors on yourself by pressing Z, similar to eating
      food. (Suggestion 12789)
  - rscdel: SCPs were removed from the game.
  - bugfix: Facehuggers will now climb back into the egg morpher if they are directly
      on top of it, instead of dying in bulk.
  Waltermeldron:
  - rscadd: Incubating larvas in a host will now be displayed in their proper colour
  - bugfix: You can now place special structures 2 tiles within other special structures
      again.
  - tweak: icon_state no longer locked behind debug
  - tweak: Buildmode backend has been improved significantly
  - rscadd: Basic buildmode is now advanced buildmode, but without shallow copying
  - rscadd: 'Advanced buildmode will now perform shallow copying, copying all of the
      values and references from one object onto another. Use '
  - rscadd: (Advanced buildmode) Shift + left click will spawn in an object without
      copying the original object
  - rscadd: (Advanced buildmode) Shift + right click will delete all objects on a
      turf
  - rscadd: Admins now have access to the matrix editor
  - rscadd: 'Xenomorphs can now put hostile xenomorphs into their spawnpool for larva.
      Queens give 3 larva, T3s give 2 and T2s give 1. T1s and larva will give no larva
      (Alardun #12747)'
  - rscadd: 'Larvae inside a host will now be coloured towards whichever hive it belongs
      to (Alardun #12747)'
  - rscadd: 'Hosts of a different hive can be re-infected by your own hive. Stealing
      hosts during XvX is now a viable strategy (Alardun #12747)'
  - rscadd: 'Acid spray will now damage hostile weeds (Alardun #12747)'
  - bugfix: Readying up is now more reliable. You can smash the button 50 times again
      without switching back to unready.
  - bugfix: Tasers will now hit and uncloak the scout specialist
  - bugfix: Commandos are now able to use their cloaks again. They are, however, unable
      to use any weapons whilst cloaked
  - bugfix: Pooled larva count will now update when you place a body into the spawnpool
  - bugfix: Vanguard's rooting ability has been fixed
  - experiment: Research now has the potential to make predaliens with a lot of luck
      and research credits

      new screech that will disable any nearby predator cloaks
  - rscadd: Predaliens can now heal on weeds but have less health
  - tweak: Buildmode no longer copies datums.
  - rscadd: Added the USCM Weapon Codex, which shows information about different weapons.
      Examining a weapon will bring up a hyperlink, which can then be clicked to view
      information on the weapon
  unwaveringgrey:
  - bugfix: Powerloader claws can no longer be transferred to others using the give
      verb.
2020-07-23:
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Crit is now hardcoded to happen at -50 health again for humans. So you
      go into crit when pain takes you there or when you hit -50 hp.
  - tweak: Painkillers linearly decrease as the pain goes up, so the higher the pain,
      the less effective painkillers. Increased Tramadol and Inaprovaline's painkilling
      effect.
  - tweak: Fixed Brig pausing timer not working.
  - tweak: Fixed Incident Summary on JAS not working.
  - tweak: JAS will now automatically update security records when an Incident is
      exported. There is no way to delete these or edit them, so careful making bogus
      Incidents.
  Waltermeldron:
  - bugfix: Fixed a small bug with ERT calls
  - rscadd: Toggle buildmode can only be used on people with R_MOD and greater
2020-07-24:
  Awantje:
  - tweak: Changed wristblades so they do not need a swap hands to both deploy.
  - tweak: Yautja use the skill system now.
  - tweak: Removal of -1 melee and cqc skills. All skills default to 0 now.
  - tweak: Removed 1.5 melee bonus on Aliens but added 1.5 more force to marine melee
      weapons.
  Jeser:
  - experiment: 'All vendors changes:'
  - tweak: 'A lot of backend changes in new vendors code. They now support: custom
      offsets for vending, being tipped over, vending delay, vending, denying and
      broken animations, randomized items vending (CLF equipment, for example), different
      factions NanoUI backgrounds.'
  - tweak: Crusher charge will now properly knockdown new vendors.
  - tweak: As a compromise between hacking system of old vendors and total lack of
      hacking in new vendors, a simplified hacking was added to new vendors, allowing

      tell whether you can hack it if you have required skill. To hack vendor, you

  Vicacrov:
  - experiment: Marine defences were slightly altered. I expect to see more barricades
      to be built and more to be destroyed by the Xenomorphs. Timers were increased
      to avoid cheesy dropping-op-stuff on top of T3s. If these changes lead to tedious
      megaFOBs, Xenomorphs may be given more tools to destroy them. Plasteel cades,
      for now, remain unchanged - I do not want to tweak too many things at once.
  - experiment: 'Metal barricades were tweaked in the following ways:'
  - tweak: Their cost was lowered from 10 -> 5.
  - tweak: Their health was lowered from 450 -> 300.
  - tweak: When destroyed by engineers, they return their full value (10 -> 5).
  - tweak: When destroyed by other means, they return less than half their value (5
      -> 2).
  - tweak: Barbed wires still give +50 health (for 2 sheets, a metal cade of 5 sheets
      has 300 health - it's a net loss, but useful for blocking pounces).
  - experiment: 'The portable composite barricade was tweaked in the following ways:'
  - tweak: Its health was lowered from 400 to 350 (metal cade + barbed wire).
  - tweak: Its deployment time was increased from 0.5 seconds to 2 seconds.
  - experiment: 'Reinforced tables were tweaked in the following ways:'
  - tweak: Its health was lowered from 200 to 140. (They cost 2 metal sheets + 2 rods,
      a barricade built from 5 sheets have 300 health.)
  - experiment: 'Special marine structures were tweaked in the following ways:'
  - tweak: Their deployment time was raised to 3 seconds (from 2 and 1 seconds) except
      for the flag (which remained 1 second).
  - rscdel: Removed the RNG chance of instantly breaking sentries/tesla/etc. They
      now always break below 15% health.

      whenever a yautja is infected. Can be used to nest a yautja, and can only be
      unnested by a xeno

  - rscadd: (Passive) Gain a token every kill. Deal 1.5x more damage to yautja. Maximum
      of 10 tokens.
  - rscadd: (Ability 1) Leap. Used for quickly jumping over obstacles. Doesn't stun
      at all
  - rscadd: (Ability 2) Battle Roar. Disables the cloaks of everyone nearby and puts
      predator's cloak into a long cooldown. Boosts the damage and speed of any nearby
      xenos, with the intensity and duration scaling depending on the amount of tokens
      the predalien has
  - rscadd: (Ability 3) Smash. Roots everyone in a radius, with the range depending
      on the amount of tokens the predalien has
  - rscadd: (Ability 4) Devastate. Roots an adjacent target in place for a second
      before dealing an immense blow upon them. Damage depends on the amount of tokens
      the predalien has
  - bugfix: Fixed larva not spawning
  - tweak: Intercom pickup ranges have been restored to default on the Alamo and Normandy

  Vicacrov:
  - tweak: The maximum number of evolution pods were reduced from 5 to 2. Instead
      of 0.2 evo, they now give 0.5. (Evo boost remained the same, but you don't need
      to build that many evo pods anymore.)

  - tweak: RPG no longer has miniscope
  - bugfix: Defenders cannot rest while fortified any more.
  Vampmare:
  - rscdel: Queen minimap over xenos removed. It was not being used enough to warrant
      the extreme performance cost of tracking everything. Xenos have other tools
      to keep track of each other.
  Waltermeldron:
  - bugfix: Fixed overlays on xenos staying when they should not.

      walls. The same for window frames, except they get destroyed. 10 hits for walls.
      3 hits for window frames. 5 hits for reinforced window frames.
  - tweak: Girder cost is now 2 metal instead of 5. Window frame is now 5 instead
      of 15.
  - rscadd: You can now build reinforced window frames with 5 plasteel.
  Vicacrov:
  - experiment: Survivors received the following update. This is part one of ??? who
      knows, but they need more updates than this.
  - rscadd: Added the following preset - Engineer. It is the only survivor having
      engineer (2) level construction (plasteel cade, windows, etc). Similar to the
      Miner, they can also operate Powerloaders.
  - rscadd: Added the following preset - Gang Leader. It is a leader-type survivor
      on Prison Station. They have less melee than Prisoners, but they gain two levels
      in the leadership skill.
  - rscadd: Added the following preset - Trucker. It is the only survivor having crewman
      (3) level vehicles, meaning they can operate the APC/tank and their weaponry.
      (Life is dangerous in the outer rim.) However, they cannot operate the powerloaders.
  - rscdel: The following survivor presets were removed from the game - assistant,
      atmos tech. They did not fit our gameplay anymore. (Rip atmos.)
  - rscdel: The following survivor presets were removed from the spawnpool (but can
      be still manually applied by staff) - botanist, civilian, salesman. They did
      not have a meaningful toolset to help you surviving.
  - rscadd: 'The Engineer has the following skills: engineering (2), construction
      (2), medical (2), endurance (5), powerloader (2).'
  - rscadd: 'The Gang Leader has the following skills: engineering (2), construction
      (1), medical (2), endurance (5), cqc (1), firearms (1), leadership (2).'
  - rscadd: 'The Trucker has the following skills: engineering (2), construction (1),

      backpack instead of your waist.
  - tweak: Survivors now spawn with weapons on Prison Station as well.
  - rscadd: Survivors now spawn with either a double barrel shotgun or an M41A MK1
      on their waist. They only have one mag for it.
  - rscadd: 'A new item spawner was added: survivor ammo. Anywhere - not near the
      hive - there is a chance that 3 (in total) boxes of buckshot / M41AMK2 mags

2020-07-31:
  NethIafin:
  - bugfix: Fixed Shaman Carrier not giving shields to other xenos.
  - tweak: Completely reworked Boxer Warrior skillset.
  - rscadd: Boxer Warrior passive - KO Counter. Every hit against same opponent builds
      up KO counter. Slashes and disarms give 0.5 counter, while Punch and Jab give
      1 counter. Changing target or not attacking target for 5 seconds will reset
      the counter. This includes abilities and usual attacks.
  - rscadd: Second Boxer Warrior passive - Clarity. Boxer warrior can shrug off limited
      number of adverse effects (like daze and knockdown) before those effects can
      actually do something to it. Boxer Warrior starts with 6 stacks of clarity and
      regenerates one point each minute. Uppercut regenerates Clarity based on how
      much KO points they have.
  - rscadd: Jab - 4 seconds cooldown. Range 3 ability that Boxer can use to reduce
      distance. On hit it does not deal damage, but slows and dazes target for 2 seconds
      (assuming 0 Endurance). It also resets Punch cooldown.
  - rscadd: Punch - 4 seconds cooldown. Range 2 ability. On hit it deals same amount
      of damage as usual warrior punch, but does not break bones. This ability also
      pushes target 1-2 tiles away from you, and resets Jab cooldown.
  - rscadd: Uppercut - 10 seconds cooldown. If you are near your target you will automatically
      hit them. On contact it will put your Jab and Punch on cooldown, reset your
      KO counter and heal you for 5% of max hp times the KO counter. It will also
      do following effects if the KO counter is high enough (all of them is KO counter
      is bigger or equal to 9)
  - rscadd: If you have at least 1 KO point during Uppercut it will deal 15 damage
      per KO point
  - rscadd: If you have at least 3 KO points during Uppercut it will knock back target.
      This knockback scales with KO points and will deal damage if target hits wall.
  - rscadd: If you have at least 6 KO points during Uppercut it will knock down the
      target for 3 (or more) seconds (assuming no Endurance). This scales with KO
      points.
  - rscadd: If you have at least 9 KO points during Uppercut, target will be slept
      for 10 seconds and will be completely out cold.
  - tweak: Boxer max Clarity nerfed 6 -> 3.
  - tweak: Boxer Clarity regen delay reduced from 60 seconds to 15 seconds.
  - tweak: Uppercut no longer restores Clarity.

  - bugfix: Fixed Boxer getting frozen in place (stunned) by explosives while Knockdown
      was absorbed.

      minimum and maximum tackles. This is 100% subject to adjustments/complete redo.
  - experiment: You must have at least MIN tackles in order to land a tackle. If you
      reach MAX tackles, you are guaranteed a tackle. Each caste has a tackle chance
      CHANCE, and the tackle counter resets after 4 seconds.

      if opened on WO map and won''t show regular jobs that don''t have respective
      WO counterparts (SEA and Intelligence Officers currently). IMPORTANT: for preference
      saving system, these jobs are viewed as their regular counterparts, so saving

      mentorhelp.
  NethIafins:
  - tweak: Removed screenshake from Boxer Warrior Jab and Punch abilities.
  Vicacrov:
  - rscdel: '"Survivors no longer spawn with the overpowered sawn-off (oops) or the
      M41A MK1 (reported to be underperforming)."'
  - rscdel: '"There are no more random M41A MK1 ammo spawns, only boxes of buckshot."'
  - tweak: '"The boosted early game evolution for Xenomorphs to combat the early marine
      deathball vs young T3s was halved (x4 -> x2) as the T3s evolve with full strength
      now. Xenos get T3s in about roundstart + 14 minutes. (1218 under normal circumstances.)"'
  - tweak: '"The Almayer dropships'' and the monorail''s first deployment lockdown
      timer was changed from 1215 to roundstart + 15 minutes. (1219 under normal circumstances.)"'
  - tweak: '"The boosted early game evolution now lasts for 15 minutes instead of
      10 minutes. (Compensation for the above.)"'
  - rscadd: '"Survivors now spawn with the HG 37-12 pump shotgun with a 100% chance.
      Their secondary weapon is still randomized."'
  - bugfix: '"Corpsespawners with survivor presets no longer spawn guns, resulting
      in ten gorillon sawn-offs in xeno starting zones (bigger oops). Only survivors
      with an active client get guns now."'
  - tweak: '"The survivors'' (and the ERT''s) HG pump shotgun now starts with buckshot
      instead of slugs."'
  Waltermeldron:
  - bugfix: Boilers can bombard past resin membranes again.
  - tweak: Boilers can no longer bombard past resin membrane that doesn't belong to
      their hive.

2020-08-07:
  NethIafin:
  - rscadd: Added new strain to Runner - Acider. They lose all standard runner abilities
      and are a bit slower than standard runners (about lurker speed)
  - rscadd: Acider Passive - Acid Storage. Every time Acider Runner is hit, they gain
      Acid equal to amount of health lost. Acid is also gained (although very slowly)
      with time. Max amount of acid is 1000
  - rscadd: Acider Passive - Acid Slashes. Any Acider melee attack applies an acid
      on their target and if target was already covered with acid, some amount of
      acid will be added to acid storage while acid stack on enemy will be regained.
      This acid can be used by Spitters to activate their acid wave explosion.
  - rscadd: Acider Active 1 - Corrosive Acid. Spend 100 acid to cover barricade, item
      or vehicle with boiler acid. The application of acid is 4 times faster than
      usual.
  - rscadd: Acider Active 2 - FOR THE HIVE! Prepare yourself to sacrifice for the
      hive. Can only be activated when above 200 acid is stored. This changes color
      of the runner and initiates a sound loop that notifies surrounding hostiles.
      After 20 seconds Acider Runner will explode covering all barricades in area
      (acid/100) with normal acid (won't melt reinforced barricades, usual barricades
      will survive only if repaired at the same time), all enemies with acid stacks,
      and deal up to 200 burn damage to all enemies in the radius (damage tapers off
      at max range). If Acider Runner gets killed during this ability, nothing will
      happen and explosion will be cancelled. If Acider Runner survives and ability
      activates, after 3 seconds Acider Runner player will get a free (at no cost
      to the hive) larva if hive has spawning pool. Acider runner can cancel this
      ability by using it again, but this will set Stored Acid to 0
  - tweak: Acider Runner no longer gains Acid by taking damage. The only way to gain
      acid now is waiting and slashing someone with acid on them.
  - tweak: Acider Runner speed increased (still less than normal strain runner).
  - tweak: Acider Runner For The Hive! max acid spread reduced to 5 tiles. Burn damage
      spread is same.
  - tweak: Acider Runner For The Hive! now is superslowed instead of being slowed
      (0.75 delay increase to 1.5 delay increase).
  - bugfix: For The Hive! is now bound to action 3.
  - bugfix: For The Hive! cannot be activated while resting or knocked down.
  - bugfix: For The Hive! should now properly put you into new larva

  Waltermeldron:
  - tweak: Decreased Queen defuse timer for nukes from 15 seconds to 5 seconds
  - rscadd: Changed the Big Red CL spawn to spawn in as an R&D Assistant Manager.
      They outrank the CL, but belong to a separate division; they cannot and should
      not give orders to the CL.
  - rscadd: Assistant Managers and above can increase the clearance to 5-X with no
      purchase required.
  - experiment: Corporate Liaisons can now get a rank up to Executive Specialist depending
      on their playtime as a CL. See below for the playtimes.
  - rscadd: (0 hours) Junior Executive. (16 hours) Executive. (32 hours) Senior Executive.
      (64 hours) Executive Specialist.

  TobiNerd:
  - tweak: Gave humans higher alcohol tolerance. Please stop passing out.

  - bugfix: Fixed not being able to target players as a clan leader
2020-08-15:
  Jeser:
  - bugfix: Fixed bad check for magazine types when trying to put magazine into magazine
      box.
  - rscadd: Added misc and non-standard boxes to cardboard build list. Fixed naming
      of other boxes.
  - rscadd: 'Changes to ammunition boxes: transferring rounds is now a series of timed
      actions where 40 rounds are transferred every 1.5 seconds. That means extended
      and big magazines like M41AE2 will take longer to refill than before. Clicking
      ammunition box with appropriate magazine on HARM intent will start transferring
      rounds from magazine to the ammo box.'
  - soundadd: 'Interactions with magazines and bullets such as: taking bullets out,
      filling magazines manually and from ammunition boxes are now accompanied by
      new sounds.'
  Tobinerd:
  - bugfix: Fixed fire chems stacking their base values with their modifiers, making
      them either super powerful or super weak in different areas. Things are normalized
      again now.
  - tweak: Several fire chems has been slightly tweaked compared to how they were
      before the flame update. Numbers will be on the wiki.

      points.'
  - imageadd: New M10 Technician Helmet sprites by Frans_Feiffer.

  - rscadd: Added per-armor drilldown to weapon codex so now you know what weapon
      does what to what amount of armor.
  TobiNerd:
  - tweak: Made the greyscale sprites for fire brighter so they contrast with reddish
      turfs more and made the burncolor of UT-Napthal Fuel a bit brighter.
  - tweak: There's now a hard limit for how many corpses that can spawn per map at
      round start. This should decrease lag on maps that had a high amount of corpse
      spawns.
  Triiodine:
  - experiment: Shuffled corpse placement on Sorokyne, and replaced a few with gib
      spawners instead.
  - experiment: Put Sorokyne Strata back into normal map rotation.

      look, though you can't get them back once you do! Only works for standard Squad
      Marine uniforms.
  Waltermeldron:
  - rscadd: Fueltanks can now be reinforced with 5 metal sheets. Using crowbars will
      take off this metal shielding. Reinforced fueltanks cannot blow up at all except

  - tweak: Acid runners do more damage to xenos when they kabloom now.
2020-08-18:
  Jeser:

  Neth:
  - rscadd: All vended items are now saved in the database, so I can make even more
      charts, without bugging you guys with questionnaires. (This was 95% done by
      Neth, love you, boss).
  Triiodine:
  - experiment: Greatly reduced the degree to which snow tiles slow down humans and
      aliens.
  - experiment: You can now only get stuck in snow that has rocks in it.

  - maptweak: Added some patches of snowy rocks to Ice Colony.
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Ravagers now get stunned from explosives and take 20% less explosive damage
      compared to before. Rav directly hit by a HEDP is a 0.6 second stun.
  Vicacrov:
  - tweak: Unified structure climbing timers. Climbing tables no longer takes 5 seconds.
  - tweak: The following climbing values were changed (for the sake of unification).
      Window frame climbing was changed from 1.5 seconds to 2 seconds. Handrails were

      storage briefcase, escape pod panels, old vending machines.'
  Waltermeldron:
  - bugfix: Fixed the zombie species, as well as the presets.

      brute damage slightly.
  - tweak: There is now a minor stun after getting regurgitated via the regurgitate
      verb.
  - tweak: Adjusted numbers related to fire stacks. Extinguishers still work the same.
      Custom flames will work differently.
  - tweak: DURATION = how long fire lasts and how many fire stacks you get when lit
      on fire, INTENSITY = how much damage you get on direct hit and plays a role
      in damage from being on fire.
  - tweak: 'Note: fire stacks are capped out at 45, so you cannot have higher than
      45 fire stacks at a given time.'
  - tweak: 'Pyro greenflame: DURATION = 60, INTENSITY = 15 (INTENSITY was nerfed from
      20)'
  - tweak: 'Pyro blueflame: DURATION = 40, INTENSITY = 40'
  - tweak: 'Napalm: DURATION = 20, INTENSITY = 30 (INTENSITY was buffed from 20)'
  - tweak: 'Gel: DURATION = 1, INTENSITY = 15'
  - tweak: Alien resists remove 10 stacks. Alien extinguishing pats remove 5 stacks.
  - tweak: Hunters resists remove 25 stacks. Extinguishing pats remove 10 stacks.
  - tweak: Human resists remove 10 stacks. Extinguishing pats remove 10 stacks.
  - tweak: Lowered passive fire stack removal to 0.5.
  - tweak: 'Damage from being on fire as xeno: [80% of INTENSITY] + [20% of INTENSITY]*[%
      of fire_stacks relative to DURATION]'
  - tweak: Damage from being direct hit by a flame has only been changed for napalm
      and pyro greenflame.
  Vicacrov:

  Jeser:
  - bugfix: Fixed approved requests in Req showing their author as approver.
  TheDonkified:
  - tweak: Tackles on knocked down people use the same min-max system for when people
      are standing up (before you had a flat 80% chance to miss on knocked down humans
      and 95% chance to miss on knocked down hunters).
  - tweak: When trying to tackle a Hunter, the min and max tackles are increased by
      2 for each caste.

      Council request.

2020-08-26:
  Lengord:
  - imageadd: Added full and half full states for backpacks, coding by Vampmare.
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Reworked the IFF backend. IFF is now based on the shooters faction and
      the ID on the human hit/not-hit. For performance reasons, the IFF faction is
      reset once a magazine is loaded instead of each shot, so if you pick up a random
      gun with IFF, reload the same magazine to make sure it matches your faction.
  - rscadd: The ID computer can now add and remove IFF for factions. You can only
      add and remove factions the authorized ID has.
  - tweak: Survivors spawn with survivor and marine IFF.

      half of her hive being onboard.
  - tweak: Raised the specialists' armor storage slots from 2 to 3, to be in line
      with regular (light, medium, heavy) armors.
2020-08-27:
  TobiNerd:
  - maptweak: Replaced snow tiles on Corsat with the less laggy autoturf variant.
  - maptweak: The airlocks into Omega from Gamma and Theta are now 4 tiles wide and
      the walls surrounding them are now destructible given there's no space between.
      The ceiling is too low for vehicles to enter Omega through the Gamma and Theta
      airlocks.
  Vampmare:
  - bugfix: Fixed Flak not behaving correctly. The bullet will now have IFF as usual.
  - bugfix: Fixed corpses not showing up permadead.
2020-08-28:
  TobiNerd:
  - experiment: Decreased the number of items physically located on maps by merging
      them into tables and racks.
  - experiment: Placing most items on tables or racks will now merge the item into
      it. However, the items should remain as interactable as usual. Holding CTRL
      while clicking a table or rack with an item will force the item to be placed
      on the table, rather than trying to click an item on the table.
  - bugfix: Fixed pixel accurate item placement on tables (yes, apparently we had
      this but never noticed because it was bugged).
  - tweak: You can now open storage containers with middle clicks as an alternative
      to drag and drop. Opening a storage container on a table or rack MUST be done
      using middle click.
  - tweak: If you want items on a table listed you should use ALT click.
  - tweak: To prevent people from accidentally flipping tables from muscle memory,
      you now need to be on harm intent to flip a table.
2020-08-29:
  Jeser:
  - bugfix: Fixed new ammunition sounds playing for shotgun ammo boxes.
  - tweak: Undeployed ammo boxes sprites now have small offsets.
  - rscadd: Added ammo boxes path option for Quick Create Object.
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Adjusted all the spec armour stats. They're now medium armour, but better
      in two stats. Grenadier remains the same. Demo, faster and more bomb resistance.
      Scout, faster and melee resistance. Pyro, acid resistance and internal damage
      resistance. Ghillie, faster and acid resistance.
  - tweak: Demo armour is no longer restricted to only hold RPG.
  - tweak: Reduced Lurker slash damage from 45->35.
  - tweak: Hedgehog Ravager is now immune to small explosion stuns. Oppressor is also
      immune again.
  Waltermeldron:
  - rscadd: Pointing now has an animation.
2020-08-30:
  Vicacrov:
  - maptweak: The Almayer's kitchen and R&R area was expanded with its own hydroponics
      area. It has the same access requirement as the Kitchen and it has its own set
      of shutters.
2020-08-31:
  TobiNerd:
  - bugfix: Intel detector now detects vial boxes on tables again.
  Vicacrov:
  - bugfix: The kitchen hydroponics' seed vendor's access requirement was removed.

2020-09-01:
  Waltermeldron:
  - rscadd: Pred limit now scales with population
2020-09-02:
  Jeser:
  - tweak: 'If job gets slot opened, it will stay open for the rest of the round now,
      whether current population satisfies slot unlocking requirements or not. Reason
      why this was changed in a simple example: player gets spawned as Squad Specialist,
      but 20 minutes later has to go to cryo. However, by this time, a dozen or two
      marines have died and amount of alive and active USCM personnel humans is lower
      than required for 4th Specialist slot to be opened. This results in slot being
      locked. In most cases, for the whole round.'
  - bugfix: Fixed Adjust Job Slots verb not doing anything.
  - rscadd: Added verb for staff to debug Role Authority system.
2020-09-04:
  Jeser:
  - bugfix: Fixed dropships being permanently stuck if attempted to fly on transport
      mode while not having a respecting LZ mapped.

  - tweak: Magazine Pouch slot number was increased from 2 to 3.
  - tweak: Large Magazine Pouch slot number was increased from 3 to 4.
  Waltermeldron:
  - rscadd: Agents now have a new ability that allows them to receive their objectives
      whenever they're ready.
  - tweak: Agents can now disable their suit tracker. This'll easily give them away
      if caught.
  - rscadd: Added a new item that Agents can use to retrieve their gear. They start
      with 40 points and can spend these points on various gadgets and tools. This
      may be expanded upon later to give the opportunity for Agents to gain points
      by completing objectives.
  - rscadd: This item can convert ammo into rubber bullets by hitting them with the
      briefcase whilst the magazine is full. Only works for some magazines. Rubber
      bullets can be used freely to defer MPs and are completely non-lethal.
  - rscadd: Agents can now attach signalers to doors to help them plan and possibly
      stop people from chasing them.
  - rscadd: Added a new stamina system. MP tools and rubber bullets use this system.
  - rscadd: Taser has been reworked to have 16 shots and high fire rate, at the cost
      of no longer being able to instantly stun people.
  - rscadd: Rubber bullets have a unique firing sound that distinguishes them from
      normal bullets.
  - tweak: Melee weapons and fists no longer have RNG knockdown. This is in preparation
      to tie them in with the stamina system.
  - rscadd: MPs can now carry people by aggressively grabbing their target and dragging
      their target onto themselves whilst on the grab intent.
  - rscdel: Removed neck grabs.

  - rscadd: Ordnance Canister now come with an activable Blast Wave Dampener. This'll
      drastically increase the rate at which the explosion falls off past 2 cells.

      that Mortar and Rocket casings must be toggled on the warhead itself, not the
      full assembly.

2020-10-14:
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Reworked the RoleAuthority and rolling of roles. Special roles are now
      rolled with everything else, this helps with balancing and some other backend
      stuff. First a fake rolling of marines are done, to get a approx number of roundstart
      marines. Then xeno pop is calculated based on that. Then roles are actually
      rolled depending on priority, with xeno first, then command then everything
      else in that priority.
  - tweak: Xenos now get 1/5 xeno to marine ratio roundstart. Smallhosts are spawned
      with a 1/20 host to marine ratio. Every 4th late joining marine gives 1 xeno
      larva. This should help balance out the lowpop to highpop differences and make
      it more fair across the board.

2020-10-15:
  Carlarc:

      accuracy.
  - tweak: This means it wil be powerful in close range, fine at midrange, and weak
      at long range.
  - tweak: M39 AP has been tweaked to be more AP and less damaging.
  - tweak: M39B/2 buffed to go along with the m39 buff.

  alardun:
  - rscadd: Added the possibility of an ID lock to bags and satchel. It may be toggled
      via an ID card, and prevents opening/emptying/picking up the locked bag. This
      lock may be overridden by characters with Command Tablet access.
  - rscadd: Added the M63A1 bag to the Heavy Grenadier Specialist kit. This bag can
      only carry grenades, and features an ID lock.
  - rscadd: 'Added jagged shrapnels. They have significantly more chance to cause
      shrapnels in humanoid, and slows down Xenomorphs for 0.2s per shrapnels hit. '
  - rscadd: 'Added the M74 Airburst Grenade (AGM-F: Airburst Grenade Munition - Fragmentation).
      It''s a GL/UGL-only grenade that spray shrapnels in a cone in the direction
      it landed toward. The grenade detonate upon stopping (so they can rebound).

      requires the usage of both hands to fire and had its capacity reduced by 1.
  - bugfix: Shrapnels no longer have a 100% miss chance against their originator (e.g.
      whoever threw the grenade). This means hand-thrown HEFA or M15 are significantly
      more dangerous if you're within the shrapnel radius.
  - tweak: The M92 now count down remaining grenades each time it fires.
  callunaborealis:
  - bugfix: Horizontal acid holes are now shown again for vertical wall turfs after
      being melted by xeno acid. It now uses the correct icon and allows xenos to
      pass through a vertical wall turf. Previously all acid holes were vertical regardless
      of the wall turf.
  - tweak: Xenos will now know the direction of the acid hole being created through
      the chat prompt when generating acid onto a wall.

      cannot go beyond 10, and are consumed upon casting Empower Boiler Traps.'

  TobiNerd:
  - rscadd: When using the Synthesis Simulator in AMPLIFY, SUPPRESS or RELATE mode,
      you now get 3 options for the new recipe component. The chosen component will
      either replace one of the existing recipe components or be added as an additional
      component. If you choose to add a rare component in this way you get 1 credit
      refunded.
  - tweak: Tweaked the value of some of the neutral properties.
  - tweak: The Synthesis Simulator will now display the expected new OD threshold
      of a chemical before running the simulation.

      allows researchers to create a new chemical from scratch.
  - rscadd: When creating a new chemical, researchers get to choose the properties,
      OD, name, and the rarity of recipe components.
  - rscadd: The cost of creating a new chemical is based on all of the following.
      The level of each property, the number of property slots used, the OD level
      and the rarity of each component. Basic, common, uncommon and rare components
      add a +7, +4, +1 and -5 modifier to the cost respectively. Negative properties
      and most neutral, depending on the value of the property, decrease the cost
      rather than increase it. A penalty cost is added for each property above level
      5 (+1 at 6, +2 at 7, +4 at 8, +5 at 9, +7 at 10). The minimum cost of creating
      a chemical is 5 credits.
  - rscadd: The properties ATX, ACR, NGN, HPX, TXC and CRS are available for creation
      mode at round start. Scan chemicals in the XRF analyzer to make more properties
      available. Anomalous properties can not be added via create mode.
  - wip: CREATE mode does not take into consideration whether the properties you enabled
      might conflict and cancel each other out. So don't try this, you'll just waste
      your credits.
  - bugfix: Fixed an old bug with how we check if a recipe already exists. This was
      why researchers more often that they were supposed to, ended up with recipes
      of 4 or more components and why the simulator seemed biased towards adding more
      rare components.
  Unknownity:
  - bugfix: Synthetic survivors are now able to access the USCM Synthetic vendors

  - rscadd: Added a new type of pouch, available in medic vendor, as well as a few
      in medical lockers, or produced at the medilathe. It is a reagent container
      with a capacity of 480 that can be refilled at reagents storage tanks and machinery
      and can refill custom autoinjectors (and only them). It also has space for one
      injector. The medic pouch is prefilled and also comes with one custom 15x6 injector.

  - rscadd: 'Ability 1: Prepare Position. After 4 seconds uninterrupted by anything,
      enter a cloak-like state. Your collision is removed (you still can get shot
      by non-friendly projectiles), you become near-invisible, and you enable Aimed
      Shot. Moving breaks the cloak entirely, and shooting make you more visible for
      5 seconds. The shooting visibility debuffs stack and only resets once you stop
      firing for 5 seconds.'

      a lock-on on the target and channels for 1.25 seconds, then automatically fire
      at the target if the bullet has a chance to connect (No turf/blocking structure
      in the way/ Line of sight is still there). The shot is homing, though somewhat

      the fire stack if they weren't already (they typically are), and blinds for
      ~2 seconds on Big Xenomorph (including fire-proofed one), ~5 for anything else.
      (Blind is the eye-blurry effect you've seen on marines).
  - rscadd: Added a critical hit effect to Sniper Flak Bullet. The backlash is removed,
