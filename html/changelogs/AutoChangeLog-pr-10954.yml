changes:
  - rscadd: "Added ignition and evaporation to liquid fuel spills (its duration might be reduced if there is little fuel present and it only does greenfire damage); also randomized its spread and marked it as harmful (checked for synths and extinguishers)"
  - balance: "Removed the weed removal aspect of the toxic property (since now toxic welding fuel is ignitable)"
  - balance: "Spray bottles volume reduced from 250->150 but default amount per transfer reduced from 10->5 (25 uses->30 uses; 10 is no longer an option)"
  - balance: "Water backpack sprayer volume reduced from 500->250 (100 uses->50 uses)"
  - balance: "Spray bottles use delay increased from 0.5/0.25 seconds->1.5 seconds"
  - balance: "Water backpack sprayer delay increased from 0 seconds->3.5 seconds"
  - balance: "Chem smoke now spreads 4x less reagents and smoke flamer range was reduced from 5 to 4"
  - rscdel: "Removed antiweed grenades and loadouts (replaced a survivor loadout with a fuel filled watertank instead)"
  - bugfix: "Fixed some potential ways for sprayers to be used to spray harmful substances by synths"
  - bugfix: "Fixed liquid fuel stacking extra amounts depending on the quantity of objects in the turf"
  - refactor: "Refactored logic for chem sprayer and synth foam backpack sprayer"
