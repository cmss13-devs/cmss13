changes:
  - rscadd: "Added rolling encryption Caesar cipher minigame to maintain comms clarity without a comms tower."
  - rscadd: "Added punch card papers which can be used to copy values for the minigame that can also be written on, bundled, faxed that actually visually display the punched data. Using blank punch cards on one of the computer restocks 5 punch cards. Some can be randomly found with intel loot."
  - balance: "Comms clarity now degrades over time (only matters if comms are down) but can be reset back to near full clarity using the cipher minigame."
  - qol: "Fax windows now open with the same dimensions as papers (larger)."
  - bugfix: "USCM and WY paper item icons are now properly set on Initialize."
  - bugfix: "The photocopier now sets the correct amount of papers when copying a bundle."
  - bugfix: "The objectives_controller no longer adds items to object contents twice."
  - ui: "Added 3 interfaces: Decoder computer, Cipher computer, and Encoder computer."
  - code_imp: "Papers and faxes now support adding additional stylesheets and header data (used to accommodate punch cards and give them flavor of a white background when faxed)."
  - refactor: "Reworked stars_decode_html to use a regex and is much faster at parsing."
  - imageadd: "Added punch card assets including two background and two logos used (WY and Hyperdyne)."
  - maptweak: "Changed 3 of the computers in CIC and placed a few blank punch cards on the table next to them."
  - config: "Various configs changed to accommodate this, namely that challenge words can be configured for the minigame. The first word determines the length of all."
