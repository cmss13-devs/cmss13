  - rscadd: "Additionally, adds a trench whistle, capable of further enhancing leadership orders at the cost of longer cooldown, slowing you down momentarily, and audibly revealing your location"
  - balance: "Changed the normal whistle cooldown from 10 seconds to 5 seconds, putting my trust in everyone not to spam this shit"
  - balance: "These trench whistles are only available to SLs, COs, and XOs, and remains a vendor choice for the FTLs and SOs"
