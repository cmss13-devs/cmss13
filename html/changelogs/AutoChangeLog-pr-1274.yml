  - rscadd: "Standard issue marine backpacks can now be equipped to most allied xenos (Runners/Praetorians/Drones/Defenders/Warriors/Sentinels/Spitters) and accessed. Use a pack in help intent on a xeno to strap it to her after a duration. Access it with an empty hand in help intent after a duration. Drag a xeno with a pack to you when you have an empty hand to unstrap it from her after a duration."
  - rscadd: "Added the Shake verb to storage items. Humans and xenos can now shake emptyable inventories which has a 75% chance to drop an item if there are any. Xenos also have a 25% chance to cause the pack fall off them when empty."
  - balance: "Resin fruit is now class size medium but size cost large so five can fit in a backpack."
  - soundadd: "Emptying a storage item now uses the existing rustle sound (or whatever use_sound its configured to use)."
  - soundadd: "Unequipping a backpack now uses the existing rustle sound (or whatever use_sound its configured to use)."
  - imageadd: "Added sprites for regular and medical packs on Runners/Praetorians/Drones/Defenders/Warriors/Sentinels/Spitters."
  - code_imp: "Any storage item that is STORAGE_ALLOW_EMPTY now either adds/removes empty_verb and toggle_click_empty depending on if the user is a xeno."
  - code_imp: "Refactored /atom/movable/vis_obj/xeno_wounds so it can be more generic as just vis_obj (now it will be used by both wounds and packs and packs don't need to be xeno_wounds) and use VIS_INHERIT_DIR instead of a signal."
  - bugfix: "Xeno wounds no longer inherit hive color."
