  - balance: "Made minibatteries tiny."
  - refactor: "Added boldwarning span macro."
  - imageadd: "Improved locator tube sprites: Now has a pop-out battery slot at the top that shows up if emptied. The main green stripe is now a battery indicator with appropiately-faded-out yellow warning and blinking red danger sprites. The small notch at the bottom is now a bracelet indicator that turns off without a battery and blinks red if the bracelet was somehow destroyed."

  - bugfix: "Fixed a bug in which a string referenced a null var."
