changes:
  - rscadd: Aiming a shot on a sniper rifle now adds a red laser beam that connects the target and the aimer. Spotting designators will emanate a faint yellow one. Both will slowly increase in alpha from 0 to max as the tracking progresses.
  - balance: The sniper's laser beam can be disabled with a button, but keeping it enabled reduces aiming shot time. Cloaked spotters will not cause a beam to appear.
  - imageadd: Completely resprited the indicators for spotting (it's now yellow) and aiming (it's now red, usually)
  - imageadd: The XM42B and PMC sniper rifles have more intense blue lasers and reticles.
  - rscadd: Stepping through laser beams will check for eye protection, if it isn't sufficient, and the small probability chance passes, the target will scream in pain! Completely flavor. If they have enough eye protection, it will bounce off their headgear, and if said protection is BiMex patented personal shades it will create a cool visual effect.
  - refactor: Refactored eye_protection to have three levels, flavor, flashes, and welding. Sunglasses have flavor protection, sechuds have flash protection, welding gear has welding protection.
  - imageadd: The spotter's designator now has a white band on it to distinguish it from the rest.
