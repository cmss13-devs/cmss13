  - balance: "Base and Shaman Carriers now have 500 base plasma, up from 400. Eggsac remains at 600 plasma."
  - balance: "Base and Shaman Carriers can now store up to 8 eggs, up from 7. Eggsac now can store a whopping 12 eggs, up from 7. Be careful not to die while carrying those and give Marines greeno material!"
  - balance: "Shaman can now plant weeds. This bumped all their other abilities one slot over shortcut-wise."
  - qol: "Eggsac's egg generation ability is now a toggle that uses plasma per tick to generate eggs at an ongoing rate until full or out of plasma."
  - code_imp: "Hivelord's Resin Walker now uses the same toggle structure."
  - bugfix: "Hivelord's Resin Walker now deactivates properly when you run out of plasma."
