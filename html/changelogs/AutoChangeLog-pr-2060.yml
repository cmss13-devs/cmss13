  - balance: "The MP27 is a now robust and ergonomic option with no wield slowdown now, though it does have a lot of scatter due to its dense bullets and cheap construction. However, due to a factory mixup almost all of its magazines have been randomly manufactured as 20, 30, or 40-rounders."
  - rscadd: "The MP5 is, effectively, a slightly slower firing but more damage dealing M39, with small-sized magazines."
  - rscadd: "The FN FP9K is now a VERY robust, quick-shooting, long-ranged SMG that mantains its AP bullets and small-sized 50 rounder mags. Keep an eye out for these."
  - rscadd: "The MAC-15 and Uzi are now bursting inaccurate beasts, the latter a slightly slower firing, slighty more damaging version. Both have recieved extended magazine sprites and overlays, the latter's also having a small jam chance.."
  - imageadd: "The PPSH has special codersprite stick magazines and inhands now! Fitting a drum magazine there will cause the gun to have worse handling, with more slowdown, worse aim delay.... and jamming! Both the PPSH and uzi can now jam, needing you to mash the unique action hotkey. Comes with unique SFX. The PPSH's base stats have been significantly improved as well, making it a longer-ranged, less falloff, but less damage alternative to the M39."
