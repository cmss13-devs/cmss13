changes:
  - ui: "re-added the old multiple highlight system, originally made by thedonkified. You can add up to 10 individual highlights, customise their colours, and toggle if they highlight the whole message or not."
  - ui: "you can now use regex for text highlighting. The syntax is /[regex expression]/, eg /dog[0-9]/. There are no quantifiers, but you can use capture groups. The regex must read a minimum of two characters."
