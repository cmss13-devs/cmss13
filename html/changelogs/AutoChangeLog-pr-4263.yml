  - rscadd: "IO's and FTL's can now purchase a 'welding visor' from their vendor. This visor grants whichever helmet it is attached with the ability to flip a protective visor that prevents the user's eyes from taking damage while welding."
  - balance: "The M12 Helmet, normally used by FTL's and USCM Officers, can mount two visors at once, instead of only one."
