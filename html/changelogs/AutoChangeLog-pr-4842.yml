changes:
  - rscadd: "Added Buckled, Handcuffed and Legcuffed screen alerts"
  - code_imp: "Ported /tg/ status effects backend, modified with timers to let effects end at appropriate time"
  - code_imp: "Stun, Knockdown and Knockout now use the new effects backend"
  - balance: "Due to backend change, all KO/KD/Stuns may behave differently timing wise. This is of course subject to adjustments."
  - balance: "Endurance is now set at 8% effect duration reduction per level above 1. However it now compounds with species bonus. Feel free to adjust."
  - balance: "Knockdowns are not inherently incapacitating anymore and many sources of it have been updated to also stun to make up for it."
  - bugfix: "KO/KD/Stuns do not artificially and randomly ''stack'' due to incorrect timer offset calculation anymore."
  - bugfix: "Stuns now correctly apply Stun reduction values instead of Knockdown reductions."
  - bugfix: "Crawling can now be interrupted by a normal move, if you are fit enough to do so."
