changes:
  - rscadd: "Introduced ASRS supply pools. As proof of concept, ASRS now spawns a crate of food ingredients every 30 minutes, in addition to regular gear."
  - balance: "ASRS now keeps track of partial crates awarded. This means if you should receive 2.5 then 2.5 crates, you now get 2 then 3, rather than 2 and 2. This is intended to result in smoother, more reliable transitions and scaling with varying amount of Xenos on map."
  - balance: "Amount of ASRS crates awarded was reduced by about 15.5% to make up for crates carrying over. Overall this should result in an about 5-10% reduction in highpop crates, and ~10% increase in lowpop. Pop being based on xeno count."
  - code_imp: "Refactored part of ASRS supply code to be less of a painful, antique artifact."
  - bugfix: "Fixed incorrect weighting in the ASRS supply code, effects on crate distributions are unknown."
  - bugfix: "Fixed HPR ammo ASRS packs failing to spawn and ending up as MK1s instead."
  - bugfix: "Fixed ASRS order numbers not increasing the order IDs... This whole time.."
