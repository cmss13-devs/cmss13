  - bugfix: "The M56D and the M2C now retain their labels when disassembled"
  - bugfix: "The M56D can now be charger crushed when not fully assembled"
  - bugfix: "The M56D being run over by a vehicle now undeploys the gun correctly (so it retains the gun if it had a gun)"
  - bugfix: "Fix an edge case that could duplicate the M56D when charger crushed"
  - balance: "The M56D now retains the health of the gun through all of its different disassembled states"
