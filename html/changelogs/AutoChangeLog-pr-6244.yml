changes:
  - ui: "Finalizes the TGUI React port and brings us back into parity again with TG's interface components"
  - ui: "Strip panel is now larger with sprites at 64x64 instead of 48 because as an Image component now they didn't alias the same."
  - ui: "VOX panel's second tab now doesn't overlap the other buttons"
  - ui: "Wiring panel for some machines is now restored to use circular indicators again"
  - ui: "Smart fridge interface is more in line with sorted inventories as far as layout & tooltips"
  - ui: "Tacmap drawing interface is tweaked a little to deal with the changes to dropdowns + clicking the tab is now disabled again until the tacmap is ready (It needs minimap subsystem to fire to have icons when flattening the map to be up to date)"
  - ui: "Reworks RestrictedInput number handling"
  - ui: "Adds the DMIcon, VirtualList (deferred lazy list), Dialogue, MenuBar, StyleableSection, and Checkbox TGUI components (but nothing uses them yet)"
  - ui: "Chat: Adds a clear chat button clearing the current tab, mute button to disable unread notifications for a tab, and updates the word highlight regex for case sensitivity"
  - ui: "Updates the ship manipulator window to allow replacing any Shuttle"
  - ui: "Fixes the supply pod panel not displaying its byondui map correctly"
  - ui: "Fixes the research terminal duplicating papers in display old mode."
  - ui: "Updates the tgui_input_list to for new features like hotkey selection, duplicate key handling, etc"
  - bugfix: "Fixes thinking runtimes when quickly switching between tgsay categories"
  - code_imp: "Shuttle subsystem now is less aggressive with reservations (skipping deletion if below a threshold, delaying reservation if above a threshold)"
  - bugfix: "Fixes F5 key still refreshing a TGUI window even if default was set to be prevented (e.g. Hotkey interface)"
