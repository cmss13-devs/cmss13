Level of difficulty affects the quality of properties and complexity of the recipe, however, the harder - the more points you get to manipulate the chemical in synthesis simulator."
  - rscadd: "ADD mode in synthesis simulator, This is a replacement to CREATE mode, in this mode you can add a property to target chemical at no disadvantage for the target chemical, however the reference chemical is \"damaged\" and simulator wont accept it anymore."
  - rscadd: "9 Hydro exclusive chemicals. Atropine, more powerful epinephrine but deals brain damage, Thymol an extremely weak anti parasitic, Psoralen a powerful carcinogenic and more. Found only in certain plants during a mutagenic process."
