  - rscadd: "Giant lizards are now capable of breaking structures and their combat capabilities are slightly enhanced. Several other tweaks and minor additions have been made, such as wound overlays and tongue flickering."
  - rscadd: "After a random amount of time, a 2nd wave of lizards might pop up in the jungles if their numbers are too low."
  - bugfix: "Giant lizards no longer become paralyzed after getting disarmed, nor will they randomly become paralyzed due to weird combat logic."
