changes:
  - ui: "The ghost observer tacmap will now scroll both horizontally and vertically as needed to display a large map."
  - ui: "The TGUI panels for tacmaps and drawings have been polished to utilize more minimap space fully."
  - refactor: "Refactored minimap generation code to calculate min and max faster, to more aggressively trim minimaps, and to support larger minimaps (was 480px now 512px)."
  - bugfix: "Fixes an issue where predator tacmap would take over the ghost tacmap preventing it from opening for observers"
