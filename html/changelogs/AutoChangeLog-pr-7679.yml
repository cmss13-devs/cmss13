changes:
  - balance: "Player huggers now have to wait 1 minute to respawn as a lesser on successful hug (same as death). They can still immediately respawn as a hugger on successful hug."
  - balance: "Lesser drones respawn time has been increased from 30s to 1 minute."
  - bugfix: "Join as xeno button/verb (much like larva queue) no longer considers a recent hugger/lesser death as a reason to deny it."
  - bugfix: "Fixed join as xeno button/verb allowing 0 health afk xenos to be controlled."
  - bugfix: "Fixed the xeno_bypass_timer gamemode flag skipping inactivity checks."
  - refactor: "Refactored some of the join as xeno code inconsistencies and changed prompts to tgui_alert"
  - spellcheck: "Mentioned eggs when using join as facehugger verb."
