  - qol: "ChemMaster - Adding new pill bottles only opts in the first bottle for filling automatically. Selected pill bottles copy first selected pill bottles colour/label upon being selected. Added Pill bottles no longer copy colour/label of the first pill bottle added. Is also now scrollable."
  - bugfix: "ChemMaster - Allows making pills without Pill Bottles again. Stops trying to fill up full bottles. Disallows trying to fill up bottles that lack the space in each selected."
