changes:
  - code_imp: "Coded the new in_hands for the knives and IDs in."
  - code_imp: "All satchels have received a new mechanic that allows, upon right-click interaction, changing on which shoulder the strap will be on in the on_mob (Works only with satchels that have straps). Code by Blundir."
  - imageadd: "Backpacks and Belts needed to be updated to accomodate better new in_hands, given that they were outdated and persistently overlapping with the character's hands (and overlapping with objects being held by those hands, making stuff ugly)."
  - imageadd: "Swords have been updated to fix some mistakes I have done in the past, and the katana looks less like a knife now!"
  - imageadd: "All knives added by Zenith have now received proper in_hands, and fixes have been done to already present ones. W-Y bayonet added by Blundir has also received an exclusive in_hand."
  - imageadd: "ID cards and badges have received proper in_hand and on_mob versions, matching a little more with their object counterparts."
  - imageadd: "Most scabbards have also received visual improvements to match with the in_hand versions of the long blades, and the ceremonial sword's scabbard have received a major fix and looks much better now."
