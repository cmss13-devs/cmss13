changes:
  - code_imp: "Changed how human hand-held blocking is handled."
  - code_imp: "Items that can be used as shields have a base percentage chance of being used, reduced by factors such as if they need to be wielded (and aren't) or not."
  - balance: "Most entities that act as shields for humans are now directional only, and cannot block things that are not in a roughly 75 degree arc of where the holder is facing. (Facing NORTH blocks from NORTH-WEST, NORTH and NORTH-EAST)."
  - balance: "Machetes and other long blades have a 15% base chance of blocking melee attacks, but cannot block ranged attacks."
  - balance: "Xeno pounces can only be blocked by a small number of large weapons."
