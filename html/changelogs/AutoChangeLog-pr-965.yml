changes:
  - rscadd: "Added \"Globber Boiler\", which is a total replacement of base boiler, designed to kill the \"safe\" gameplay loops of current base boiler in an attempt for a more challenging and fun caste to both play as and against."
  - balance: "Globber Active 1 - Bombard: Spit a large acid glob that will, upon impact, immediately spread a gas glob of your choice"
  - balance: "Globber Active 2 - Spray acid: Instantly sprays a line of acid"
  - balance: "Globber Active 3 - Shift spits: Switch between acid and neuro gas globs. Acid deals damage while neuro slows, blinds and eventually knocks down marines. Neuro has a larger radius than acid"
  - balance: "Globber Active 4 -  Acid shroud: A quick windup action that dumps an acid cloud over the boiler. Cooldowns other abilities similar to dump acid."
  - balance: "Globber Active 5 - Zoom: Short-ranged zoom with no windup."
  - balance: "Globber Passive: Globber features armor, but it is weaker against flames! Stay away from fire!"
  - refactor: "Refractored some minor spit code and icons"
  - balance: "Neuro has been completely reworked to deal mainly stamina damage, causes dizzyness and has a small chance to make you 'stumble' in a random direction along with minor tox damage. Stay out of it!"
  - rscadd: "Completly reworked neuro gas, it now uses a proper effect with escalating effects the larger the dosage rather than RNG."
  - bugfix: "Acid now deals damage to cades and now has a good chance of going over instead of being airtight"
  - bugfix: " Boiler globs no longer can target mobs and track them."
