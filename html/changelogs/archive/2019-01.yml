      will start building up 1 tile sooner and will build up a bit faster.
  - tweak: Corrupted Hive can toggle slashing permissions like a normal Hive. You
      should still listen to your human overlords though...

  - tweak: Speed mutators have been refactored to multiply xeno's speed after everything
      else has been taken into consideration. Expect fastest castes to be a bit slower,
      but slowest castes to be a touch faster. Overall, xenos shouldn't break the
      speed barrier of the game anymore.
