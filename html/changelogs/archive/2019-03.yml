  MattAtlas, Triiodine:
  - rscadd: The M5A6 smartpistol has been added. It can be found in Requisitions vendors.
      This pistol fires IFF AP ammunition.
  - rscadd: The M39 arm brace stock has been added. This stock makes one handing much
      better while making wielding much worse. It can be found in the Requisitions
      attachment vendor.
  - rscadd: Light and Heavy armor types have been added to the PFC marine vendors.
      As you would expect, Heavy armor protects significantly more against melee and
      bullets, while also covering feet. Light armor protects less but you run faster.

      hit them.
  - rscadd: The smartpistol has its own unique belt that can also be gotten from Requisitions.

  - rscadd: L41A Battle Rifle - easy to carry, doesn't slow you down, worse accuracy
      when wielded than M41A, better accuracy (slightly) when not wielded over M41A.
      This weapon can't burstfire but can become super precise with the help of attachments.
  - rscadd: Battle Rifle uses its own magazines that use standard M41A ammo. Each
      magazine can contain up to 20 bullets, except extended mag that contains 35
      bullets. There is also AP variant with standard capacity.
  - rscadd: Battle Rifle can quickly (1 second) detach and attach its barrel attachment.
  - rscadd: 'Battle Rifle can have following attachments: suppressor, bayonet, red
      dot, flashlight, extended barrel, quickfire adapter, magnetic harness, carbon
      stock, scope, miniscope, IFTS Mini-Scope.'
  - rscadd: IFTS Mini-Scope - Unique attachment for the Battle Rifle. It allows you
      to zoom with offset akin to miniscope but has no drawbacks/benefits to accuracy
      or scatter. Scope also gives a small slowdown to movement speed while scoped
      in. Scoping in takes up to one second.
  - rscadd: IFTS Mini-Scope can be only received by taking mini-sniper kit or being
      Medic/Engineer and picking it as your free attachment.
  - rscadd: IFTS Mini-Scope has IFF but it also lowers your RoF.
  - rscadd: Carbon Stock - unique attachment for the Battle Rifle. Gives Battle Rifle
      a significant increase in accuracy while only increasing wield delay and size.

      IFTS Mini-Scope, Carbon Stock, 2 Battle Rifle AP mags.
  - rscadd: Composite Deployable Folding Barricades - barricade that can be deployed
      in 3 seconds without any training. They can be repaired without skill for 40%
      of their health. If Folding Barricade took more than 40% of the damage, it's
      maximum possible health after repairs will lower.
  - rscadd: To collapse barricade, drag its deployed sprite onto yourself. Collapsing
      a barricade takes 10 seconds.
  - rscadd: Folding Barricades are resistant to acid (cannot be melted), cannot be
      jumped over (as if they had barbed wire) but do not slash back. They cannot
      be rotated or moved, they can be only undeployed and then redeployed.
  - rscadd: Folding Barricades can only be carried in hands or on the back instead
      of backpack.
  - rscadd: Folding Barricades are extremely rare.
  - rscadd: Added 4xFolding Barricade to req for 100 points.
  - rscadd: 'Added a rare requisition only kit - Heavy Support Kit. It conists of:
