2019-05-05:
  Cakey:
  - bugfix: Removed all walls under windows in Desert Dam.
  - bugfix: Fixed desert dirt being strange.
  - bugfix: Fixed tank secondary and support use hotkeys (middle mouse and ctrl-clicking
      based on active weapon).
  Fourkhan:
  - bugfix: Cryotubes now work again.
  - tweak: Cryotubes automatically eject patients after their wounds are healed.
  - tweak: Rebalanced Ravager spin slash.
  - tweak: Decreased damage by ~30%.
  - tweak: Marines targetted by spin slash will now be knocked over.
  - bugfix: Icon now correctly updates when the ability is on cooldown.
  - bugfix: LOOC now works inside the tank.
  Frans_Feiffer:
  - imageadd: High Command has authorized a new, more fitting design for the Command
      Tablet.
  John Titor:
  - wip: A number of balance changes have been made to prepare for new Xeno strains
      in the following weeks.
  - tweak: Refactored xeno health scaling. Xenos receive their largest growth in HP
      at Elder, while Ancient is now a very small increase.
  - rscadd: Moderately increased xeno health across the board, with more favor toward
      flimsier castes. Ancient lurkers are no longer weaker than ancient drones.
  - rscadd: Halved the time it takes for a ghost to occupy a buried larva. Xenos will
      obtain reinforcements from deadchat faster.
  MattAtlas, Vicacrov:
  - rscadd: Squad leaders, attention! Squad-based requisitions have been added west
      of your squad preps. It will be your (and your acting variants') job to manage
      them.
  - rscadd: These requisitions outlets have all three vendors found in cargo, however
      they have less stock overall. These numbers are not final and will change!
  - rscadd: Acting squad leaders have access to the squad requisitions rooms.
  - rscadd: All squad roles now have an attachments box (the same as WO's) in their
      vendor.
  - tweak: Flare ammo is now IFF.
  Neth:
  - rscdel: Old armor logic was killed, thrown out of the window and buried.
  - rscadd: New armor logic works as direct % damage reduction. If armor is too high
      compared to damage, further reduction is applied.
  - rscadd: Damage for a lot of guns was changed. Health and armor for both sides
      was changed. Thus there is no point in giving changelog for them... but still
      see far below.
  - rscadd: Armor hardiness is added to xenos. The longer xeno stays in combat, the
      less effective armor becomes up to the point of being completely useless. Your
      armor value is displayed to the right as a shield icon.
  - rscadd: If xeno doesn't take damage to armor for 30 seconds and is on weeds, the
      armor regeneration will start. It will take 15 minutes for crusher to go from
      0 to 100, and 5 minutes for low armored units like spitters, warriors, hivelords,
      burrowers.
  - rscadd: Smaller xenos have evasion, which basically adds accuracy required to
      hit hostiles properly. Naturally, castes that don't have armor have this characteristic.
      Evasion goes better with upgrade for those castes.
  - rscadd: If you have more than 60% hardiness you regain armor faster. For example
      crusher will recover from 60% to 100% in 3 minutes.
  - rscadd: Warding pheromones no longer give armor and damage reduction. Warding
      increases needed critical damage to die, reduces damage to armor up to 50% on
      max level.
  - rscadd: Burrowers are stronger in combat so they can be backstabbing semi-combat
      caste, but they are slow above ground.
  - rscadd: Changed how many xeno-larva spawn from latejoin marines.
  - rscadd: Queen heal and give plasma are made stronger to accomodate new HP values
      for Xeno.
  - rscadd: Xeno progression is now fixed, so every caste progresses in a same way
  - rscadd: Runners, Drones, Sentinels, Boilers, Lurkers now have no armor and can't
      get any. They pretty much don't need armor integrity and are expected to get
      by with just pure health pool.
  - rscadd: CPR can now extend defibbable time for marines if you do it no often that
      once per 10 seconds.
  - rscadd: All weapon nerfs have been removed. M41 normal ammo received big damage
      increase. Slugs have less armor penetration but slugs break armor a lot faster.
      M39 normal ammo damage buffed. Flechette buffed, buckshot back to old damage
      values but armor can make it not as good as before. Buckshot should be good
      against unarmored.
  - rscadd: Smartgun is super accurate (because it's smart), deals not very much damage
      but breaks armor fast.
  - rscadd: Sentry turrets are very accurate but suck at armor piercing. Use it against
      quick enemies and use m56 against armored targets.
  - rscadd: SMG fire rate and damage buffed.
  - rscadd: Recovery is nullified while xeno is on fire.
  - rscadd: Bipod increases rate of fire of sniper rifle by 150%
  Ranged66:
  - tweak: Gave simple mobs (carp, npc aliens etc) attack animations and fixed hunter
      spiders.
  - rscadd: The Runner caste has gained a weaker long-range vision ability for scouting
      purposes.
  - rscadd: Airlocks now get damaged by projectiles and gained special effects upon
      being destroyed.
  Slywater:
  - bugfix: Fixed more wall-windows on Trijent.
  - bugfix: Fixed Eastern power on Trijent.
  - tweak: CPR can now prevent suffocation.
  TheDonkified:
  - rscadd: Defibbing someone will make you unpushable.
  - bugfix: Fixed sprite issues with revolvers and break action shotgun sprites.
  - bugfix: Gun attachments are visually removed now.
  - bugfix: Flamer sprite will change when unlighting again.
  - bugfix: Fixed railgun losing zoom upon upgrading.
  - bugfix: Removed the ping message.
  - bugfix: Fixed commander medals not being as long as they used to be.
  - bugfix: Fixed resin structures not showing proper name in textlog and made hivelord
      structures show 'thick' for appropriate structures.
  - bugfix: 'Fixed tank middle and ctrl click not working. Note: it is not cyclic.
      Order of hardpoints are prioritized in the following order: primary -> secondary
      -> support. This is regardless of which one is currently selected.'
  - bugfix: Repairing hardpoints should actually repair 10% of their health now.
  - bugfix: Apostrophes should appear properly in situations where they previously
      didn't.
  - bugfix: Gun overlay should properly update now.
  - bugfix: Eggsac carrier can no longer store huggers.
  Vicacrov:
  - rscadd: Assigned overwatch officers now show up on the stat panel for each squad.
  - bugfix: Fixed the stat panel not updating for marines.
  - tweak: Reworked the left half of lower medical on the Almayer. The details are
      as follows.
  - tweak: Chemistry can be now manned by two personnel to help medics at the early
      game rush. Its equipment was expanded accordingly.
  - tweak: The door to the Treatment Center is now in line with the Alamo's starboard
      hatches.
  - tweak: The top-left equipment room was merged into the bottom-left one and the
      new chemistry was moved into its place.
  - tweak: Chemistry got a new vending machine called WeylandChem Plus. It only has
      chem bottles, doubled amount. They vend directly into your hand and their transfer
      amount starts out maxed.
  - tweak: Added advanced first aid kits, syringes, and syringe cases for public use.
  - tweak: Defibrillators were added to the Treatment Center so doctors are less likely
      to take them.
  - tweak: The premade cryoxadone beakers were moved to chemistry.
  - tweak: Added more rollerbeds for public use and one more welding helmet.
  - tweak: Defibrillator rechargers, vendors, and body bag boxes are now closer to
      the entrance for easier accessibility.
  monkeysfist101:
  - imageadd: Added cigarette packet inhands.
  - tweak: Modified Macho Sauce to accommodate diet drinks.
  - tweak: Reorganized most drink files and culled redundant drink reagents.
  - imageadd: Souto now has inhand sprites.
2019-05-14:
  TheDonkified:
  - rscadd: Reworked the squad distribution computer so that almost anyone can be
      assigned to a squad. The only people who cannot be assigned to a marine squad
      are untrained civilians such as doctors. You must grab the person and click
      on the squad distribution computer to "scan" them in, and make sure they're
      standing next to the computer during the squad change/assignment.
  - tweak: Self-examine is slightly more descriptive in very niche situations.
  - tweak: You gain your original speed back much faster after being healed/getting
      surgery.
  - tweak: Made 'Go to Lobby' the default option when you do not get your job. Make
      sure your prefs are set to the correct option.
  - tweak: Made the M56D mount more resistant to explosions. Damage to melee will
      remain the same.
  - tweak: The clunkiness when setting up the M56D has been reduced. You still need
      to place the mount and setup the M56D as you normally would before. However,
      once the M56D has been fully built, you don't have to keep placing the mount
      and then the M56D. Instead, mount remains attached to the M56D and you only
      have to setup it up and screwdriver M56D to set it up again at a different position.
      Sprites by Frans.
  - rscadd: M56D mount can be constructed. First you need 5 plasteel (this is excuse
      for resistance to explosions). Then 10 metal and weld. Placeholder sprites for
      now.
  - tweak: Motion detector can fit in armor slot now.
  - rscadd: Humanoid mobs can no longer hurt others when on HELP intent. This includes
      shooting and melee. If there are any situations that I missed, report on Gitlab.
  - rscadd: There is now a preference to disable NON-HELP intent actions on YOURSELF
      from going through. For example, if you keep PBing and you accidentally hit
      yourself during screenshake.
  - tweak: Medic and engi vendors allow you to pick a vest instead of being constrained
      to webbing. Other specialized roles will still only get default webbing.
  - rscadd: Can repair broken vendors as squad engi+. Steps are screwdriver -> wirecutter
      -> 5 cable coil -> 1 metal -> screwdriver.
  - rscadd: Engineers can deconstruct all deconstructable machines now. However, they
      can't rebuild them (MTs+ can do that though).
  - bugfix: Supply console in req can be repaired.
  - rscadd: Burrowers can rename tunnels.
  - tweak: Railgun has lower delay between shots (10 seconds instead of 15).
  - tweak: Railgun always hits barricades.
  - tweak: Railgun does more damage to barricades.

  - tweak: SL reqs were given a queue and were a bit remodelled.
  - rscadd: Specialists now have access to SL req.
  - rscadd: Intelligence Officers now have vendors instead of lockers.
  - tweak: Intelligence Officers now can hack APCs and airlocks instead of being able
      to build barricades.
  - tweak: Quick Clot and Peridaxon pill dosages were lowered to 7 from 10, to avoid
      instant ODing when two people administer them simultaneously. (OD threshold
      is still 20.)
  - tweak: Epinephrine is now made of Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and yields twice as
      much as before.
  - rscadd: Pilot Officers and Synthetics can now regain control over the dropship
      by using the console - provided they can hack it for 3 minutes without dying.
  - bugfix: Folding barricades, just like any other type of barricades, cannot be
      deployed on the dropships anymore.
  - bugfix: Intelligence officers now spawn with a pair of insulated gloves.
  - tweak: MPs were given morgue, SL req, and engineering accesses.
  - tweak: Predator Young Bloods were renamed to Bloodeds.
  - tweak: Triggered trap messages in the hivemind now appear in a smaller, italicized
      font.
  - tweak: Upon evolving, the hive now gets an accurate message whether T2 or T3 slots
      are open, instead of a generalized alert.

  - tweak: Nerfed Ravager HP slightly at mature/elder/ancient.
  Neth Iafins:
  - tweak: Due to fix in MC we had to update how plasma regen works now that it is
      called less often. Plasma regen is now % related to xenos total plasma, but
      still different from caste to caste.
  TheDonkified:

      tag is added to the memorial slab.
