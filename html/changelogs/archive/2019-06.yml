  - tweak: Acid splash changes from the dev test are reverted, but expect a more thorough

  - tweak: The laser sight attachment now decreases wielded scatter too, and can be

      so no damage is the same from hit to hit
  - tweak: Marine Armor values are completely changed.

      against xeno spit) but are terrible at everything else. Experiment but remember

      for gun weight
  - rscadd: Medium armor now has 3 pockets inside and has middle armor between Light

  - rscadd: Heavy armor protects against explosions, melee and bullets. It also holds
      your intestines together so you get IB and Organ Damage less often
  - tweak: Masks defend your face against spit
  - tweak: Damage to armor only works after 0.2 of a second pass, so if you shoot
      flechette or something at xeno, armor only changes after all bullets connect
  - tweak: There is a mechanic with armor that if person is dealt damage much less
      than the armor, the armor has MORE effect on that attack. Now this mechanic
      also takes into account current armor integrity
  - rscadd: IB and Organ Damage uses new "armor-damage system". "Armor Integrity"

      which I totally didn''t forget about and added later.'
