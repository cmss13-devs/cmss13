      system.

      from one tile further away than a slash: impale and abduct. Impale does direct
      damage and abduct applies a stun.'

  - rscadd: Oppressor - Tank and AoE-oriented.
  - rscadd: 'Stats changes: Heavy armor increase in exchange for heavy movespeed and
      pheromone decrease.'

      fits their design: Base Praetorian heals nearby Xenos; Royal Guard buffs the
      damage of nearby Xenos; Dancer debuffs the accuracy of nearby marines; Oppressor
      buffs the armor of nearby Xenos.'
  - rscadd: 'Macro list for the new abilities: https://pastebin.com/GHkQgKTX'
  - imageadd: All screeches have unique colors to distinguish them for allied Xenos.
      Base Prae = Green; Oppressor = Purple; Royal Guard = Red; Dancer = Blue.

      they are shell shocked.
  - tweak: If neurotoxin hits human enough times it will force sleep on them for half
      a minute. Every time neurotoxin hits human after that, it resets sleep back
      to half a minute.
  - rscadd: Acid (except boiler) can hit xenos of a different hive. Neuro included,
      however it can't Stun or KO.
