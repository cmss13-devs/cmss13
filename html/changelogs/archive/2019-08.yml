  RavingManiac:

      explosion effect rapidly spread from the center. Perhaps, you might outrun it.
      Perhaps.
  - rscadd: 'Hotkey mode: ALT-WASD fixes mob direction.'
  - maptweak: Crashed ship on Fiorina Orbital Penitentiary made slightly more defensible.

      bins on the Almayer have USCM types. Research and the CL office has the company
      type. You can still switch to carbon-copy by using the verb.
  - tweak: In paperformatting, you can now use [uscm] to make a USCM logo or [wy]
      for a company logo. [logo] still works so you don't have to redo all your templates.
  - experiment: CHEMICAL RESEARCH UPDATE
  - rscadd: Added a random chemical generator to CM. This can generate random chemicals
      with millions of combinations for properties, recipes, names and other stats.
  - rscadd: Every round, a specific amount of these chemicals will be generated. It
      is up to the researchers to discover these chemicals and unlock their potential.
  - rscadd: Generated chemicals can have between 1-4 properties of varying potency,
      all of which can be any combination of good and bad. Discovering these will
      require thorough testing.
  - rscadd: The recipe for all generated chemicals require 3 different components,
      and maybe an additional catalyst. The components can be anything from iron to
      souto or even plasma from an alien...
  - rscadd: Chemicals with a higher number of properties tend to require more rare
      components. These may not be something you can get normally. You'll thus have
      to either retrieve a sample of it from the colony or by using hydroponics.
  - rscadd: Mutating plants in hydroponics now has a chance to make the plant contain
      a new chemical. This can also be one of the randomly generated chemicals.
  - rscadd: An XRF Scanner has been added to Almayer research. Those trained in research
      can use this to analyze the composition of a chemical sample.
  - rscadd: Chemicals scanned by the XRF might be something it can't identify. This
      means you have to obtain a sample of this first and scan that.
  - rscadd: 'Identifying a new chemical will give DEFCON, with more points from rare
      ones. You know this when the XRF prints: Saved emission spectrum of...'
  - rscadd: 'Note: The XRF does not analyze the properties of a chemical. But will
      print any infomation it might have in its database.'
  - tweak: Updated the description of most chemicals to fit better with the XRF. Not
      like you could see the descriptions before anyway...
  - rscadd: The medical computer can now print scan records onto paper.
  - rscadd: Research notes describing the random chemicals can now be found around
      research and administrative areas around maps.
  - rscadd: Vial boxes with random chemicals can now be found in research areas around
      maps.
  - wip: The above two items have yet to be added to Trijent Dam, as the map is currently
      undergoing some major changes. But will be added at a later date.
  - tweak: Researchers now spawn with a random research note. However, this note will
      only describe one of the simple chemicals. So it is just to get you started.
  - tweak: Scientist survivors now spawn with a random vial and a research note. Unlike
      the researcher's, this can be the good stuff too.
  - rscdel: Removed plant mutations for spreading vines and temperature tolerances.
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: 'Pistol Rework Commenced. '
  - rscadd: Pistols have the same accuracy when wielded and when one-handed. Akimbo
      unaffected.
  - rscdel: Dual-wielding pistols/akimbo has been nerfed. Bullet spread has been increased
      and accuracy reduced in this mode.
  - rscdel: Extended mags for M4A3 has been removed. AP and HP mags for M4A3 made
      scarce.
  - tweak: M4A3 remains a marine pistol. It offers accuracy and pure damage, in exchange
      for capacity and armour penetration. Buffed overall.
  - tweak: Mod 88 also known as 88M4 has become one of three main marine pistols.
      It is the opposite of M4A3, so it has capacity, armour penetration and a three
      round burst.
  - tweak: M44 Revolver remains a main gun, but it has been reworked. Using a speedloader
      magazine on a revolver will make it function as a normal reload. If there are
      leftover bullets in when using the speedloader, they will be dumped on the ground.
  - tweak: 'M44 Revolver ammo has changed. Normal: high damage, a little AP. Marksman:
      medium damage, decent ap and no damage falloff. Heavy: medium damage, low AP
      and a weaker version of slug effect.'
  - tweak: VP78 has replaced Mod 88 in the Self-Defense kit, spec kits and XO belt.
      The stats have been buffed to be in line with a primary weapon. More damage,
      more AP.
  - rscadd: M44, VP78, Mod 88, Smartpistol and the Mateba have all gotten a facelift,
      courtesy of Triiodine.
  - soundadd: M44, VP78 and Mod88 have gotten new sounds, mixed by Triiodine. Give
      them some time before condemning them to the gates of hell.
  - tweak: Buffed accuracy and damage of M4A3 Custom. SOs, POs and TCs spawn with
      it.
  - tweak: Buffed damage of the smartpistol slightly.
  - rscadd: A new kit has been added "Experimental Trooper Kit". It is the new kit
      to get smartpistols and everything you could need for it. It can be found in
      main req or your squad req.
  - tweak: Vendors have been changed to accommodate the above changes.
  - rscadd: Increased the slots in the mateba belt and smartpistol belt by one.
  - tweak: Some actions can now be performed one-handed, like building cades, wiring
      cades, splinting, applying kits, placing claymores and repairing cades. The
      intended use is to use a pistol in the other hand.
  - tweak: M44 Revolver stock has been changed. It can now be folded to fit in a belt
      holster or your belt slot, but it cannot fire folded. The stats are the same.
  - bugfix: 'Holsters now care about stocks again. '
  - tweak: New pain sound added, you may recognize the voice.
  - tweak: Synthetic units can now take a bit more of a beating.

      doubled the snowflake vendor points for your personal fashion shows.

      uniform dispensing something different.

  Aceluke:
  - rscadd: Added additional items to the pred ship.
  Cakey:
  - tweak: Tail sweep and spin slash macros have been turned into toggle macros.
  - rscadd: Added the TC-4T portable telecommunications kit to the Almayer, found
      in the hangar south of the Alamo. Engineers can set this up colony-side in order
      to enable communications between the ground team and the Almayer. Requires a
      TC-4T circuit board, 2 cable coils, 2 power cells, 2 manipulators and 2 filters
      to set up. Can be damaged by xenomorphs and humans alike, and must be repaired
      using a welder.
  - maptweak: Removed all functioning telecommunications from ground-side maps. Time
      to set up some dynamic FOB spots, marines!
  Frans_Feiffer:
  - imageadd: Revised an old Cabinet sprite, and added wooden variants for Mappers
      to use later.
  TobiNerd:

  - spellcheck: Gloves in the medic vendor was renamed to just gloves.
  - tweak: Nerfed ERP slightly. Hug has been changed.
  - tweak: Pistol Pouch and Smartgunner belt can now hold the M44 revolver.
  - rscadd: The USCM Pyrotechnician kit now spawns with a Broiler-T back harness.
      The M240-T cannot be used without it. However, it stores all three fuel types
      at the same time. The Broiler-T can be refueled by placing incinerator unit
      tanks into it. The current tank will be swapped out for the fresh one. The active
      fuel tank/type is visible as a HUD button in upper left. Pressing it will cycle
      M240-T munition type. The M240-T can also be stored inside the Broiler-T back
      harness, but it won't work with the auto-equip.
  - tweak: The M240 and M240-T now display the loaded tank's percentage of remaining
      fuel after firing.
  Vicacrov:
  - bugfix: Fixed a floating fire alarm and the north-south hangar shutters not being
      symmetrical.
  - tweak: The View Objectives Clues verb was updated. Now it shows way more information
      on the current DEFCON objectives. It also shows the current DEFCON percentage.
  - tweak: The roundend list of queens, predators, and medals now display in a more
      rapid succession.
  - rscdel: The roundend In Flanders Fields section was removed, the DEFCON list was
      moved to View Objectives Clues (in a simplified version).
