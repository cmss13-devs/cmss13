2019-09-12:
  Aceluke / Foolosopher / Cakey:
  - wip: Reworked the southern side of LV almost in its entirely, information on what
      was done is down below. It is highly suggested to take a machete or knife down
      to the colony now as you have a lot more natural flora to deal with on the colony
      in exchange for the new FoB changes which were made. To summarize, both LZ1
      and LZ2 are highly defensible now but outside their safety is a highly untamed
      jungle which can be cut or burned down. More updates will come for LV, but for
      now the main change has been added.
  - maptweak: Walled off both LZs on LV, allowing for more secure FoBs and a more
      set defense for marines with one major entry way and 2 side entrances.
  - rscadd: Added doorways and walls to the side entrances of the LZs so marines have
      some starting defences against xenos upon deployment.
  - rscadd: New mechanics for cutting down flora has been added. There are two types
      of blades which can be used. Small bladed weapons and large bladed weapons.
      Small bladed weapons, like the combat knife, can cut down small vegetation with
      one hit, while taking multiple hits to take down large vegetation in multiple
      hits. Large bladed weapons, like the machete, can still cut down all flora in
      one hit.
  - rscadd: Added bushes and grass-like flora all across LV, these can be cut down
      with a combat knife or higher bladed weapon in one hit.
  - rscadd: Added tallgrass all across LV, this can be cut down just like vines with
      a machete level bladed weapon in one hit, while taking 3 hits with a smaller
      bladed weapon.
  - tweak: Changed Vines to be able to be cut down by small bladed weapons.
  - rscadd: Fire can now burn down all types of flora. Bushes, vines, and tallgrass.
      Fire still spreads on tallgrass as it used to do.
  - tweak: Fire does not spread on tallgrass anymore, this was changed so vines could
      be burned down and not spread which would have resulted in a forest fire.
  - tweak: Changed predator/Yautja wristblades to be considered small blades, enabling
      them to cut down all types of flora added. Tallgrass, vines, and bushes.
  - tweak: Changed the pathing for several flora objects, allowing them to be able
      cut down if desired by staff.
  - maptweak: Cargo north of LZ1 has been moved and its outsides redesigned.
  - maptweak: Remodeled the engineering dome on LV, allowing for more open space for
      an easier time setting up power and more space to move around in.

      a lot longer if power is setup on both LV and Ice colony.
  - tweak: Very slightly increased the amount of damage a floodlight can take, it
      isn't much, but they should be able to take one more slash before breaking.
  - maptweak: More floodlights have been added to LV, allowing for almost all colony
      pathways to be lit up if turned on.
  - maptweak: Remapped a few of the nightmare creations to fit with the reworked map,
      expect some new variations for LV's nightmare modes soon.

      structures up to 13 tiles away

  - bugfix: Removed aliens in-depth understanding of tank engineering that allowed
      them to see exact modules' integrity values. Thank god it was fixed before they
      reverse engineered their own tank.

  - rscadd: Added verb for toggling stock attachments called 'Toggle Stock Attachment'.
  - rscadd: Can repair automated closets, attachment vendor, and other similar vendors
      that were previously unrepairable.
  - rscadd: Vendors in general will be more resistant to explosions. They still have
      a chance to break and require repairs from weaker explosions, however they are
      less likely to completely get deleted unless an explosion is powerful.
  - rscadd: Creating items via metal, wood, etc will try to put it in your inactive
      hand. If there is something already in your inactive hand but it is stackable,
      it will try to fill that stack if the created item is of the same type.
  - rscadd: If there are still leftovers (the new item is not the same type as the
      item in your inactive hand, there was too much of the new item, or either item
      was not stackable), then they will try to fill your active hand.
  - bugfix: Trying to repair a vendor a functional vendor with power issues will give
      a proper message reflecting that.
  - bugfix: Cupola has working IFF again.
  - bugfix: Empty HEFA box has a sprite again.
  - bugfix: Fully repaired doors will no longer show as 'slightly damaged'.

  - tweak: Scatterspit strain is now even slower.
