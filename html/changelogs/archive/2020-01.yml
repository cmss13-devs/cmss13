  - rscadd: Xeno names are now time locked. You get letters in front of your number

      playing as xeno. Three letter combo in front of the name is unlocked after 124
      hours of playing as xeno. Both options cannot be used at the same time, so either
      post-number or three letters infront. The time constraint on three letter name
      is supposed to be this big, and we expect it to be rare.
  - rscadd: You do not lose your xeno name if you did not unlock the combo for it
      and had it before this feature was activated.
  - rscadd: Mod+ level staff can reset your xeno name or ban you permanently from
      using anything but XX xeno name. This is reversible and is logged, including

      of reagent properties, for the purpose of calculating the synthesis required
      to make a new variant of said chemical. This can be done with all research chemicals
      AND several default chemicals.
  - wip: The Synthesis Simulator can currently only work with medicinal properties.
      Non-medicinal properties to follow.
  - rscadd: Mixing Synthesized chemical variants with other variants of the same kind
      or with their original form, will react them back into the original.
  - rscadd: The Synthesis Simulator runs using a new resource called research credits.
      Research credits are granted by identifying chemicals and defcon decreasing.
      More methods are to come.
  - rscadd: Survivor doctor, survivor scientist and survivor liason now holds special
      id cards that can bypass clearance level requirements up to level 3, 4 and 5
      respectively, regardless of defcon status. This can only be done by the actual
      card holder.
  - rscadd: Added a research data terminal to the research study. This machine stores
      XRF scans and synthesis reports, and shows the status of research clearance
      and credits.
  - tweak: Research clearance can now be increased using research credits at the research
      data terminal. You can still use a willing CL as a potential free shortcut though.

      a set time in the round, or by manual override using special keycards found
      on the station. These keycards trigger pings on the intel scanner.

      in research.
  - rscadd: Queen can plant eggs while in ovipositor withing 3 tiles range from her.

      be heard on Almayer and only if you have access to Almayer General channel in
      your headset or you are standing near intercom.
  - rscadd: 'Added new type of announcement: ARES shipwide announcement. It works
      like command announcement, but only for humans in Almayer z-level. It also doesn''t

      all humans on ship will see it. Currently only available for admins.'
  - rscadd: Added option for admins to choose which faction or hive they want to send
