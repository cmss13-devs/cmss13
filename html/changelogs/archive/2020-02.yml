      preferences verbs start hidden and can be shown via respective verbs, Show Ghost
      Prefs and Show Combat Chat Prefs.
  - tweak: Some very long preferences verbs names were made shorter.
  - experiment: Welcome to Proper Fireteams Part 2.
  - bugfix: Fixed several small bugs in Fireteams and Team Leaders assignments logic.
  - rscadd: Marines will receive noticeable notifications upon being assigned to or
      unassigned from Fireteam. If Fireteam has a Team Leader assigned, TL also will
      receive a notification with the name of marine being assigned to or unassigned
      from their Fireteam.
  - rscadd: Clicking with EMPTY hand on your SL/TL Tracker will bring up Squad Info
      Window. It shows important information about squad. PFCs with Technician and
      First Responder kits are marked with special icons in it.
  - rscadd: Acting Squad Leaders can manage Fireteams and Team Leaders remotely via
      Squad Info window. Use M.I.A. (Missing In Action) and K.I.A. (Killed In Action)
      statuses to mark unaccounted for and unrevivably dead marines. Legacy way of
      managing Fireteams via examining wasn't removed and still available for SLs

      level.
  - tweak: Increased number of eggs that carrier can store.
  - rscdel: Removed Eggsac Carrier Strain.
  - rscadd: Added Shaman Carrier Strain. Shamans lose all abilities besides picking
      eggs up and lose ability to carry huggers. Shamans cannot be affected by pheromones,
      no matter the level or type.
  - rscadd: 'Shamans have special abilities, all of which share following features:
      They have windup (delay before effect starts), they work proportionally to amount
      of non-Shaman xenos in radius (currently currently 3/3.5/3.75/4), they do not
      work on Shamans, they have common cooldown of 40/30/25/20 seconds (so if you
      use one ability, you can''t use others for that amount of seconds), and MOST
      IMPORTANTLY they consume an egg to cast an ability. If there is no non-Shaman
      xenos near to you, effect is cancelled but resources are used.'
  - rscadd: First Shaman ability is Adrenal Healing (100). After channeling for 2.5
      seconds, Shaman affects in radius 3 all other non-Shaman xenos of their hive
      by giving them overhealth for 30 seconds, repairing their armor, and unstunning
      them. Effect is proportional to number of xenos after channeling. No more than
      25% of armor integrity will be restored. Minimal effect is 10% for every, if
      only one other xeno was near you.
  - rscadd: Second Shaman ability is Frenzied Scream (300). After channeling for 3
      seconds, Shaman affects all xenos FROM OTHER HIVES and all humans by applying
      a 4 second (endurance may lower this time) knockdown and forcing humans to roll
      (it will extinguish fire and acid if you are lucky). The radius starts at 3
      tiles from Shaman if Shaman has 1 non-Shaman xenomorph nearby, and increases
      by 0.5 tiles per nearby xeno, up to limit of 7. This ability cannot hit same
      target more than once in 20 seconds. It also won't affect recently screeched
      by queen targets.
  - rscadd: 'Third Shaman ability is Adrenal Pheromones (300). After channeling for
      2.5 seconds Shaman starts emitting ALL pheromones with effect starting at 1
      (lowest level) when 1 non-Shaman xeno is nearby, and with 0.5 increase per xeno,
      it stops at 5 (ancient empress level). This pheromone emitting stays for 30
      seconds after which it expires. Reminder: Pheromones DO NOT WORK ON SHAMANS.'

      it doesnt show up on the other side of the wall.
  - tweak: C4 now explodes walls/windows/doors in a 3x3 around where it was placed.
      Giving it a little more breach power.
  - bugfix: C4 will now properly delete the whole window if placed on a window, and
      not just the glass leaving a frame behind.

      it should be about the same as other maps now.
  - bugfix: Made sure survivors don't spawn next to Larva on Sorokyne Strata.
  - bugfix: Added the Clown back to Sorokyne Strata.
  - bugfix: Larva that spawn in the Deep Jungle Security Outpost should no longer
      be trapped until they mature.

      navigate, or just cut past entirely.
  - maptweak: Added connecting lanes from Sorokyne Security Hall to the Northern Pass
      and Administration.
  - maptweak: Opened up the lanes leading into South LZ1. More changes to LZ1 and
      LZ2 pending.

      through the snow and ice is a much faster route.
  - maptweak: Removed a lot of in-the-way walls in the Jungle that over complicated
      pathing. Sightlines should be clearer, and defenses for Xenos more easily constructed.
  - maptweak: Spread out all the Xeno spawns on Sorokyne, hopefully this will encourage
      new hive locations. Previously all Xenos spawned in a ring in the south of the
      map.
  - maptweak: Opened up ice platforms and the base lanes in the Cryo-Thermal marshes,
      there should be more platform options, but they're not required to navigate

      map.
  - maptweak: Added a new lane into the Canteen in the South, it leads directly to
      the upper decks. The previous lane was expanded, the kitchen is smaller as a
      result.

  - maptweak: Added a new lane between south Administration to the South Canteen hall,
      this connects it directly to the Aerodrome.
  - maptweak: Removed needless platforms and railings in Sorokyne Engineering lounge
      and foyer, it should be much easier to navigate.
  - maptweak: Reduced Sorokyne from 256x256 to 256x190 tiles.
  - maptweak: Snowstorms now have to wait 20 minutes between potentially happening
      instead of 4.

  - experiment: 'Vehicle interiors have been added:'
  - rscadd: Multitile vehicles now have mapped interiors. Interaction with the vehicle
      is done by interacting with various objects inside the vehicle
  - rscadd: Interiors typically feature a driver and a gunner seat. To drive the vehicle,
      buckle into the driver's seat. To... gun, buckle into the gunner's seat. To
      stop driving/gunning, unbuckle from the seat (i.e. by resisting)
  - rscadd: Passengers may enjoy the view by clicking on the viewports inside vehicles
  - tweak: Instead of ejecting people when the vehicle is destroyed, xenos can now
      enter the vehicle just like humans while they're on help intent, and may do
      so at any time, even when the vehicle is in working order. Vehicles can be entered
      and exited by both humans and xenos even when broken
  - rscadd: Vehicles spawn in with locked doors. When you're driving the vehicle,
      you get a verb that lets you toggle the door locks. You can enter vehicles even
      when they're locked if you have bridge, brig or crewman access
  - experiment: 'Vehicles now have momentum:'
  - rscadd: Vehicles have momentum. This means they'll start slow and pick up speed.
      Turning the vehicle makes you lose some momentum. You cannot immediately go
      in the reverse direction if you have momentum, but attempting to move in reverse
      will "brake" the vehicle and allow you to begin reversing faster
  - rscadd: If you crash while the vehicle has momentum, unbuckled mobs and unanchored
      items will be sent flying
  - experiment: 'Hardpoints now function differently:'
  - rscadd: Reloading hardpoints is now done by using the weapons loader inside the

      as before. The tank can fit 2 marines
  - rscadd: The tank's turret can now rotate independently of the rest of the tank.
      To operate the turret, buckle into the gunner's seat inside the tank
  - rscadd: The tank's turret features a gyroscopic lock, which will prevent it from
      rotating along with the vehicle
  - rscadd: The tank's turret is now a hardpoint. You can install it onto and remove
      it from the tank by using a powerloader
  - tweak: Primary and secondary hardpoints are now installed on the tank's turret,
      meaning the tank must have a turret installed in order to install primary/secondary
      hardpoints
  - tweak: Projectiles shot from the tank's primary weapon now begin traveling 1 tile
      out from the tank
  - experiment: 'APCs have been added:'
