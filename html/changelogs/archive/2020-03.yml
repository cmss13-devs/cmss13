  Awan:
  - bugfix: The smart disc timer is now separate from the create crystal timer.
  - bugfix: Big self-destruct should now work properly.
  - tweak: Increased harpoon throwing damage.
  - tweak: Hunting traps take time to setup now.
  Cakey:
  - tweak: Xenos who are not fire immune will no longer recover health when on fire.
  - rscadd: Xenomorph Hive Structures have been added to the game. Special construction
      nodes can be built by builder castes, leaders, or the queen depending on the
      desired restriction set by the queen at any time. Most structures require special
      hive weeds to be built and require Plasmagas as a construction resource, which
      can be gathered and delivered to construction nodes by builder castes.
  - rscadd: Added Plasmagas to the game. Plasmagas is a resource found on key locations
      of the map and can be gathered by both factions to give them advantages on the
      field.
  - rscadd: Added hive collectors, built by the resin construction ability when targetting
      a resource node or a tile with a resource node present. Gathers 1 resource per
      10 seconds and puts it into the hive resource pool.
  - rscadd: Plasmagas nodes will span in three categories, Hive, LZ, and Primary nodes
      will spawn depending on events triggered during the round.
  - rscadd: Hive resource nodes will appear after the first hive core has been built,
      selecting whichever node is closest to the hive position.
  - rscadd: LZ resource nodes will appear next to whichever landing zone was picked
      by the marines at the start of the round, after the takeoff cooldown has passed.
  - rscadd: Primary resource nodes will appear in central and key positions in the
      map, and will start appearing after 25 minutes have passed. Once a primary node
      has been depleted, depending on the player population, a new primary node will
      appear closer to whichever faction has gathered the least resources.
  - rscadd: Added the ability to see resource node locations via the hive and command
      tacmaps.
  - rscadd: Added the hive core, a hive structure that acts as a centrepiece to all
      hives by growing hive weeds and stockpiling Plasmagas.
  - rscadd: Added the hive pylon, a remote structure that also grows hive weeds in
      a smaller radius as well as acting as a remote location from the hive to build
      hive structures and access the hive Plasmagas stockpile.
  - rscadd: Hive pylons and cores will strengthen celings above them by 1 to 2 levels
      if the area they encompass is already rooved. This will stop air support from
      being effective around hive locations.
  - rscadd: Added the spawn pool, a hive structure that can be fed bursted corpses
      in order to respawn a single xenomorph that was killed in action. Spawning can
      be disrupted by either killing the queen or destroying the pool.
  - rscadd: Added the egg morpher, a hive structure that can be fed bursted corpses
      in order to generate a total of 6 facehuggers (per corpse) gradually without
      the need of an egg. Also fires at intruders in a larger radius than normal eggs.
  - rscadd: Added the evolution pod, a hive structure that offers a bonus of 0.2 evolution
      per tick to all xenomorphs on weeds.
  - rscadd: Added the recovery node, a hive structure that slowly recovers oen xenomorph
      at a time when resting adjacent to it.
  - rscadd: Hives will now have a reduced rate of burrowed larvae after 25 minutes
      into the round. You will need to gain captures in order to efficiently grow
      your hive.
  - tweak: Default monkey spawns have been reduced from 25 to 5. Extra monkies from
      survivor spawns have been removed.
  - tweak: Young xenomorphs have been made significantly weaker. Later maturations
      have remained the same stat-wise.
  - rscdel: Xenomorph acid splashback no longer stacks and has a cooldown applied
      before the next splashback can occur.
  - rscdel: Multibursting has been removed.
  DingleFlop:
  - tweak: 'SMG recoil with the foldable stock was excessive when one handed and extended.
      #9824 '
  - bugfix: 'Wrapping paper can no longer be exploited to store large items. #8795 '
  - bugfix: 'The pistol rig can no longer hold the smartpistol. #9361 '
  - bugfix: 'WestonMed plus will now vend tricord autoinjectors, isntead of incorrectly
      vending tricord hyposprays. #10257 '
  - tweak: Revert an unintentional change where hyposprays vended empty.
  - tweak: Allows SMG on the back (new onmob icons added)
  - tweak: Allows SMG to be stored in M39 holster belt with an unfolded/full stock
      OR with a folded/no stock and a grip.

  - tweak: Changed how body is rendered. Instead of server blending all the bodyparts
      together for every body, it sends every limb to client and client builds the
      body themselves
  - tweak: Removed previews from Police Records and ID. They will be back when we
      have less issues building them. Changed how the Character preview works.
  TobiNerd:
  - bugfix: Fixed an exploit that allowed research to duplicate research credits.
  - bugfix: Synthesis Simulator should no longer create recipes containing unknown
      emissions.
  - bugfix: Synthesis Simulations should no longer randomly go corrupt.
  Vampmare:
  - rscadd: Jurisdictional Automated System implemented. All arrests will have to
      go through this machine. An incident report is made on this machine with the
      criminals ID. Take their ID off, click on the button in JAS with the ID in hand,
      they get added. Print the incident when done and bring it to the Brig Cells.
      Insert the incident into the Brig System
  - rscadd: Brig System implemented. This handles the release of prisoners. Multiple
      reports can be inserted into and activated at the same time. The selected report
      will show up as a timer. When it is time for release, ARES will notify all MPs.
  - rscadd: Forensic Scanner, when things are broken or hacked on Almayer they sometimes
      leave behind a set of prints. Scan them with the Forensic Scanner and insert
      the scanner in the Security Records computer. Read Fingerprint to see who did
      the crime and clear the scanner to scan new prints.
  - rscadd: Structural damage done to Almayer will now be announced for the whole
      ship. Destroying walls and windows. It is in our best interest to keep the ship
      whole.
  - tweak: Increased the accuracy of the Taser immensely.
  - tweak: Flashbang resistance and pepperspray resistance is now based on MP skill.
  - bugfix: A propelled chair will no longer stun xenos.
  Vicacrov:
  - bugfix: Vendors - Re-added pill bottles to WestonMed.
  - tweak: Vendors - Colony WestonMeds and WestonChem Pluses need no access anymore.
      The ability to hack the Almayer ones will be added later, as it needs a complete
      rework.
2020-03-26:
  Atebite:
  - rscadd: Queens can now banish xenos from the hive. Banished xenos can be attacked
      by all other xenos, but cannot retaliate.
  - rscadd: Queens can also readmit banished xenos back into the hive.
  - rscadd: The hive gets a burrowed larva when a banished xenomorph dies. Abusing
      this is a great way to get banned quickly.
  Cakey:
  - rscadd: Marine heavy armor will now block lurker and runner pounces, which will
      instead now only root and screenshake for half the duration of the intended
      knockdown. This applies to PFC Heavy armor, M3-G4 and B18 heavy armors, as well
      as several non-marine heavy armor sets.
  - tweak: Queens will now start with 100 plasmagas when evolving.
  - tweak: Adjusted the amount of resin pylons allowed from 4 to 8.
  Neth:
  - tweak: Changed how body is rendered. Instead of server blending all the bodyparts
      together for every body, it sends every limb to client and client builds the
      body themselves
  - tweak: Removed previews from Police Records and ID. They will be back when we
      have less issues building them. Changed how the Character preview works.
  TobiNerd:
  - wip: 'Until reactors get reworked: ship fusion engines now always start in perfect
      state with max fuel and no fuel consumption.'
  - experiment: ORDNANCE TECHNICIAN UPDATE. The Maintenance Technician is now renamed
      to Ordnance Technicnan.
  - rscadd: The Ordnance Technician (OT) keep the duties of maintaining the OB cannon
      and may perform the same duties as the old MT, but their primary active job
      is the construction of new weapons for the USCM arsenal.
  - maptweak: Moved Tank Crew quarters to the northern tank bay.
  - rscadd: Added an ordnance workshop in the area of the former tank bay. This workshop
      has everything needed to create custom explosives, although of finite quantity.
      Use your materials wisely!
  - rscadd: Added the armylathe. The armylathe is a special autolathe in the weapons
      workshop that prints weapon parts. For now this is just for custom explosives.
      MT level engineering is required to operate the armylathe.
  - rscadd: Added a demolitions simulator to the workshop. You can use this to test
      explosions.
  - rscadd: Added the demolitions scanner. This is a special reagent scanner used
      for scanning bombs and analyzing potential explosive and fire hazards. Use in
      hand to print the latest reading.
  - rscadd: You can now make custom mines, C4, mortar shells and spec rockets. Mortar
      shells and rockets need hydrogen or methane as fuel respectively.
  - tweak: Small chemnade casings can no longer be made by hand and large chemnade
      casings can no longer be made in the autolathe. Both of these must be made in
      the armylathe now.
  - tweak: Small chemnades now fit in the underslug grenade launcher.
  - tweak: MT level engineering is now required to assemble any custom explosive,
      which can generally be refered to as chembombs.
  - tweak: Chemnades can now only use timers. Custom mines can use proximity sensors.
      Custom C4 can use any of the former plus remote signal.
  - tweak: Chemical explosions and chemical fire limits are now defined by the container.
      This means that the upper limit is significantly lower for grenades than what
      it used to be, while rockets and mortars are closer to the old upper limit.
      Overall all custom explosives have an upper limit of 150-175% that of the non
      customizable equivalent.
  - tweak: Chemical explosions and chemical fire reactions can now interact with each
      other.
  - tweak: Nerfed water and potassium explosive reaction as there has been added new
      explosives.
  - experiment: Added the following new chemicals.
  - rscadd: Formaldehyde, made with 1 methane, 1 oxygen and 1 phoron. Formed in either
      a silver beaker (available in the workshop) or with silver as a catalyst. Used
      in making hexamine and paraformaldehyde.
  - rscadd: Paraformaldehyde, made with 1 formaldehyde and 1 water inside the workshop
      industry freezer. Used in making octogen.
  - rscadd: Hexamine, made with 2 ammonia and 3 formaldehyde. Used in making cyclonite
      and octogen.
  - rscadd: Ammonium Nitrate, made with 1 ammonia and 1 polytrinic acid. Used in making
      ANFO.
  - rscadd: Ammonium Nitrate Fuel Oil (ANFO), made with 2 Ammonium nitrate and 1 fuel
      oil. This is a low strength and low cost explosive.
  - rscadd: Cyclonite (RDX), made with 1 hexamine and 1 polytrinic acid. This is a
      medium strength medium cost explosive.
  - rscadd: Octogen (HMX), made with 1 hexamine, 1 polytrinic acid, 1 paraformaldehyde
      and 1 ammonium nitrate. This is a high strength high cost explosive.
  - rscadd: Explosive chemicals can now be either sensitive or insensitive.
  - rscadd: Sensitive explosives are potassium hydroxide (water and potassium), nitroglycerin
      and ANFO. These will spontanously explode if made in more than a certain quantity
      at a time or when ignited.
  - rscadd: Insensitive explosives are ammonium nitrate, cyclonite and octogen. These
      will only explode when ignited.
  - rscadd: Added the reactional chemical properties Oxidizing, Fueling, Flowing,
      Viscous and Explosive, which affect chemical fire and explosions.
  - rscadd: Added the following purchaseable supply crates to Req.
  - rscadd: Assembly crate, containing 5 of each igniters, prox sensors and timers.
  - rscadd: Pyrotecnics crate, containing beakers of sulfuric acid, ethanol, phosphorus,
      lithium, salt and potassium chloride.
  - rscadd: Phoron crate, containing 2 stacks of 30 phoron bars.
  - rscadd: Plastic crate, containing 2 stacks of 10 plastic sheets.
  - rscadd: Precious metal crate, a stack of each gold, silver and uranium.

  - imageadd: Added dynamic reagent fillings for buckets.
  - tweak: The Tool Storage Machine has been renamed to Component Storage Machine
      and a few has been removed from the Almayer. The YouTool vendor has been renamed
      to Tool Storage Machine. The Engi-Vend has been renamed to Electronics Vendor.
      The contents of these three vendors has been tweaked to be more specialized.
  - tweak: Vials from random vialboxes are now always full.
  - tweak: Proximity sensors now have IFF.
  - tweak: It is now possible to disarm C4 with a multitool, or dissolve it with acid.
  - tweak: Removed the public autolathe in the hangar.
  - tweak: Increased bucket metal costs.
  - tweak: You can now dispose reagents from the chem grinder.
  - tweak: Added mopbuckets to the autolathe for twice the cost of a normal bucket.
      Holds twice the amount.
  - tweak: Research Cells are no longer excempt from the grenade antigrief. So OTs
      don't go to research to turn them into your test lab, you aren't supposed to
      spend the whole round testing. That is why you have the demo scanner.
  - tweak: The Ordnance Technician will be restricted behind 3 hours of squad engineer
      playtime, when time restrictions are reactivated.
  - experiment: The code for almost all explosive devices were configured to be compatible
      with the above updates. If any explosive behaves oddly, please gitlab it.
  Vampmare:
  - experiment: Marine Defenses are here. This rework is intended to improve on planetside
      construction of defenses and give marines their own variant of XSS. The basic
      idea is that you build a Generator, then you gather crystals to keep it powered
      and the Generator will then power Defenses in the nearby area as long as its
      powered. Defenses are made by metal, making a base, making a module and inserting
      it into the base and welding.
  - rscadd: Added Generator, it will power Defenses in a 7x7 area around it. It is
      powered by phoron gathered by Collectors.
  - rscadd: Added Collector, this item is built from metal and when placed on phoron
      it will harvest it for any generators on the map.
  - rscadd: 'Added Tesla Coil, it will zap nearby mobs without proper ID, dazing and
      slowing them. Defenses placed one tile near it will also be zapped and turned
      off. '
  - rscadd: Added Flamer Sentry, it's normal sentry but it shoots fireballs that leave
      behind blue flames.
  - rscadd: Added Bell Tower, it will play a loud noise if an enemy moves within 1
      tile of it. It will only play the sound once for the same enemy until reset
      by new enemy running through.
  - rscadd: Added Planted Flag, it will boost nearby marines in a 5x5 radius with
      Hold order and Focus order.
  - tweak: Defense base, modules and the Generator can be crowbared to get the resources
      used back. The phoron is lost in the case of the Generator.
  - rscadd: There are now emergency phoron tanks to power Generators in the red alert
      chambers on Almayer, specifically in Engineering and in CIC.
  - tweak: Reworked the Sentry to be in line with the other Defenses.
  - tweak: Wall deconstruction is changed to weld->screwdriver->wirecutter->wrench->crowbar.
  - tweak: Barricades changed. If you are further than 4 tiles away from the barricade,
      and you're shooting from direction behind it, you will no longer hit it. So
      placing barricades every 4th tile and shooting from the back one is now possible.
  - rscadd: Added metal barricade upgrades, there are three variants you can upgrade
      your metal barricade into, you do it by clicking them with a metal stack. Each
      upgrade costs 2 metal, Biohazardous will increase its resistance against acid/burn
      damage, but decrease a small amount against brute. Reinforced will increase
      against brute, but decrease a small amount against acid/burn. Explosive will
      increase against explosive.
  - tweak: Metal cades health have been buffed slightly.
  - imageadd: Defenses and barricade upgrade sprites are done by Triiodine.
  - rscadd: Mini-engineer kit now contains a M56D fully kitted out for use. You can
      wear the M56D on your back. M56D assembling and disassembling is based on engineering
      skill.
  - tweak: The shared engineer vendor has been removed. Mortar is now only available
      from REQ. The metal and plasteel has been added to the standard engineer vendors.
      Mortar cost lowered in REQ.
  - rscadd: Jurisdictional Automated System implemented. All arrests will have to
      go through this machine. An incident report is made on this machine with the
      criminals ID. Take their ID off, click on the button in JAS with the ID in hand,
      they get added. Print the incident when done and bring it to the Brig Cells.
      Insert the incident into the Brig System
  - rscadd: Brig System implemented. This handles the release of prisoners. Multiple
      reports can be inserted into and activated at the same time. The selected report
      will show up as a timer. When it is time for release, ARES will notify all MPs.
  - rscadd: Forensic Scanner, when things are broken or hacked on Almayer they sometimes
      leave behind a set of prints. Scan them with the Forensic Scanner and insert
      the scanner in the Security Records computer. Read Fingerprint to see who did
      the crime and clear the scanner to scan new prints.
  - rscadd: Structural damage done to Almayer will now be announced for the whole
      ship. Destroying walls and windows. It is in our best interest to keep the ship
      whole.
  - tweak: Increased the accuracy of the Taser immensely.
  - tweak: Flashbang resistance and pepperspray resistance is now based on MP skill.
  - tweak: Increased maturity rate now stops after 30 minutes.
  - tweak: Added cooldown to the ARES reports.
  - tweak: Added shutters to the Brig Windows, the button is inside the shared cell.
  - tweak: Sentries will no longer shoot through smoke.
  - tweak: Removed the larva growth bonus of nested infected marines in sight of each
      other.
  - tweak: 'Scout cloak rework. It is now toggleable and lasts forever, but when cloaked
      you are unable to shoot guns. Decloaking will leave you unable to shoot for
      a short while. When cloaked you have 100% chance to evade friendly bullets.
      So friendlies are unable to shoot you. '
  - tweak: Reduced the M4RA burst-fire fire delay. Reduced the burst amount to 2.
      Increased the magazine count to 16.
  - tweak: M4RA minimum required distance is now 4 tiles instead of 6, this means
      there is only an accuracy penalty for targets within the first 4 tiles.
  - tweak: Holding the objectives/phoron nodes will now slowly grant DEFCON to marines
      and hidden points to xenos. When the hidden points reach a threshold, a XRT
      will be sent in. This is to hopefully help against stalemates. Points gain and
      so on are experimental.
  - tweak: Added four specialist kits as a DEFCON 2 reward.
  - tweak: DEFCON points and ASRS now use money to fund instead of points.
  Vicacrov:
  - rscadd: 'Medical - Operation Tables now notify doctors of the following conditions:
      patient is unconscious (surgery can be started), patient has low blood (hook
      up those IVs!), patient has a low nutrition level.'
  - rscadd: Medical - ChemMasters can now transfer pill bottles to nearby smartfridges.
