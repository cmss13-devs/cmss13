  Atebite:
  - bugfix: The vehicle part fabricator is no longer acidable
  - bugfix: The tank's artillery module can now be used. It's currently based on tank
      dirrection. This is a temporary solution until I can figure out how to make
      the zoom track the turret direction instead.
  - bugfix: Fix various vehicle module buffs not being applied correctly.
  Jeser:
  - bugfix: Fixed exploit with RPG. Again.
  - bugfix: Fixed entering vehicles after they moved away.

      [Sakuyoi]
  Neth:
  - rscadd: You can now pick an option to be Xenomorph after all marine options are
      unavailable. This still does not guarantee you the Xeno slot, since you will
      be only used in round start team balancing. (If you see burrowed/pooled larva
      round start - that will be you now)
  TobiNerd:
  - bugfix: Fixed platform corners on Corsat blocking movement in certain directions.
  Triiodine:
  - rscdel: Removed phoron resource nodes across all maps.
  - maptweak: Sorokyne Strata is now part of the low population map pool.
  - maptweak: Made Strata LZ2-Telecommunications easier to navigate.
  - maptweak: Fixed some area definitions errors on Strata.
  - bugfix: Removed all access requirements on doors, lockers, and computers on Strata.
  - bugfix: Replaced a UA 571 Sentry crate with a HPR crate on a LV NMC insert.
  - bugfix: Fixed a dictionary key corruption on Strata.
  - maptweak: Replaced LV jungle walls with Strata Jungle walls.
  - imageadd: Gave Solaris Ridge a unique wall tileset.
  - imageadd: Added a topper to the Strata Jungle walls sprite set.
  - rscadd: You can now wear W-Y Security vests with PMC Fatigues.
  - rscdel: W-Y Security vests no longer cause slowdown.
  - bugfix: W-Y Security vests now display properly.
  - imageadd: New zippo lighter sprites by NicBoone.
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Reduced the cost of marine collectors to 5 metal.
  - tweak: Increased M4RA armour penetration a great deal.
  - tweak: Removed tray functionality. It is now just a cosmetic item.
  - tweak: Defenses rework to be handheld/instant-deployable versions. Squad Engineers
      can pick one from their vendor at the roundstart, deploying it by using it and
      disassembling it by using a multitool on it. Their functionalities are mostly
      the same, no generator needed.
  - tweak: Bell Tower range increased to 5x5, whatever activates the sound will now
      be superslowed for 5 seconds.
  - tweak: Increased Sentry damage slightly.
  - tweak: Flamer Sentry now has IFF on the bullet.
  - tweak: Reduced Planted Flag range from 7x7 to 5x5.

  - tweak: 'Hive core can always be built by the Queen. Building a new one will destroy
      the old one. '
  - tweak: Spawn Pool is now the new mechanic for burrowed larva. Burrowed larva spawn
      in periods from observers or when people join xenos from the lobby. Queen does
      not need to be in ovi anymore. Giving it bursted bodies will just increase stored
      larva by 1. Renamed to pooled larva.
  - tweak: Collectors and resource nodes have been removed for now. Building structures
      requires normal plasma.
2020-04-11:
  Jeser:
  - bugfix: Fixed missing verbs for Ghost and Chat preferences.
  TobiNerd:
  - bugfix: Fixed an issue with clicking signalers on top of each other. Fixed custom
      C4 not exploding correctly with signalers.
  - bugfix: Fixed chembomb fire radius modifier not multiplying by chem volume.
  - tweak: Nerfed OT rockets max power from 350 to 300 and OT mortars max power from
      430 to 360. Both of these are still higher than the standard equivalent.
  - tweak: Overhauled the falloff values of explosive chemicals. This value is now
      more important to the radius of the explosion than before.
  - tweak: Default explosive chemicals can no longer be used with the synthesis simulator.
      The explosive property must be discovered through new chemicals.
  - tweak: Reduced the max container size for OT rockets from 240 to 120.
  - tweak: Chemical explosives now calculate falloff levels based on additives to
      a base falloff, rather than doing an average.
  - tweak: Chemical explosives now have you trade between falloff and power, ANFO
      leaning towards the former and octogen leaning towards the latter. Cyclonite
      is in between.
  - tweak: Bomb casings now use a maximum total volume of containers rather than a
      maximum individual container volume. The volume cap has been decreased to make
      it harder to make all-in-one bombs, so you have to choose a balance.
  - tweak: The industry freezer will now max polymerize 3 containers at a time. Lowered
      how much paraformaldehyde is polymerized at a time in each container from 5
      to 3.
  - tweak: The following chemicals now alter fire color much more dramatically. Carbon,
      Copper, hydrogen, lithium, methane, oxygen, phoron, phosphorus, potassium-chloride,
      salt.

  - bugfix: Fixed the demolitions scanner not scanning the warhead inside assembled
      rockets and mortars.
  - bugfix: Fixed the demolitions simulator no longer being able to create explosions
      after testing C4.
  - bugfix: C4 can no longer be placed on cades or crates, resulting in invisible
      C4.
  - tweak: C4 can no longer be placed humans that share faction.
  - tweak: If chem C4 or grenade explodes while being held by a mob or structure (walls
      are not structures), then it will now transfer full damage onto said mob or
      structure, and halve the actual explosion power.
  - tweak: Bombs with a signaler attached will now have a forced 3 second delay before
      detonating. A danger overlay will be visible for this duration.
  - tweak: 'You can now click a signaler with another signaler to copy over its code
      and frequency. #10824 Watermelon914.'
  - bugfix: Research chem names no longer end on a + or -. Apparently this was the
      reason some chems would glitch in nanoUI and become unpillable. Thanks to Alardun
      for helping discover the fix to this.
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Belts now appear empty, half-full or full spritewise.
  - tweak: Timed actions are now always visible.

2020-04-21:
  Jeser:
  - tweak: 'CTRL + Clicking target as a ghost now does one of the following actions:'
  - tweak: '- if target is yourself, you will re-enter your corpse after a confirmation;'
  - tweak: '- if target is an SSD xenomorph and all conditions are met, you will be
      transferred into xenomorph''s body after a confirmation;'
  - tweak: '- if target is a mob or a multitile vehicle, you will start following
      it;'
  - tweak: '- otherwise, you will simply jump to the tile where you clicked.'
  - tweak: Ghosts now have one unified Follow verb that allows to search by old and
      several new categories, such as vehicles, mobs by faction and by hive. Follow
      Local Mob verb is still there unchanged.
  Triiodine:
  - bugfix: Fixed the doors in LZ2 T-Comms being full of walls.
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Prespawned bursted corpses can no longer be used for spawn pool.
  - tweak: 'Sandbags no longer lose the wire after getting damaged enough. '
  - bugfix: A cloaking scout spec should now evade all shots not PBs.
  - bugfix: Flamer sentry now shoots over cades.
  - bugfix: Everyone can wire metal cades again.
2020-04-22:
  Jeser:
  - bugfix: Fixed bug with manual facehugging not being interrupted by moving host
      away. [Kendrick Lyon]
  Neth:
  - tweak: Removed default round start buff to upgrade and evolution for xenos
  - tweak: Evolution and Upgrade speed is now tied to number of xenos (more xenos,
      less upgrade), marines (more marines, more upgrade) and time (more time, more
      upgrade). To top it off, it is all finally related to number of Larva. If you
      have no larva, this bonus is not applied. The more larva you have, the proportionally
      more upgrade speed you will have. These effects are active only when queen is
      in ovipositor or first few minutes of the round.
  - tweak: Example, 100 marines, 10 xenos and 30 larva. Boost is 6.5x for the first
      ten minutes then it goes to 13x if NO XENOS JOIN after 40 minutes. If xenos
      keep joining as larva numbers lower, it will taper down, it will be about 1x
      when there are no larva left.
  - tweak: Returned basic increase for first 30 minutes for upgrade level and evolution.
      Now it's a maximum of two systems, whatever is bigger will be applied.
  - tweak: Xenos can now see their Evilution Boost level
  - tweak: Humans that are running AND without suit armor (that is actually an armor
      and not a santa suit) can now be neuroed in one hit. This applies to all neuro
      shots.
  - tweak: Added small slowdown to CLF hauberks so they cannot be abused.
  TobiNerd:
  - rscadd: Added a delivery chute in the OT workshop and research lobby that transports
      items to the requisitions.
  - rscadd: 'Added the Automated Chemical Integrated Delivery harness (A.C.I.D.).
      This special vest is will progressively scan its wearer for specific health
      issues and injecting its medicine when the conditions are met. Additionally
      it will also report the overall health to the wearer. Inspiration from #8988
      by Alardun.'
  - rscadd: The A.C.I.D. harness inject conditions can be configured by using a multitool/security
      access tuner on the vest.
  - rscadd: Research will start with two A.C.I.D. harnesses. More can be assembled
      by using a wirecutter on a webbing vest containing one healthanalyzer, radio,
      cable coil, hypospray and a battery.
  - rscadd: Added a new type of randomly spawned research note, research grants. Scanning
      these at the research data terminal will reward research credits.
  - rscadd: 'Added the chemical properties excreting, hypometabolizing, hypermetabolizing,
      sedative. Inspiration from #8970 by Watermelon914.'
  - rscadd: 'Added 10 rare chemical properties. One rare property will now spawn in
      clearance level 3 and 4 chemicals at a 30% and 100% rate respectively, to make
      them extra special. Inspiration from #8914 by Watermelon914.'
  - tweak: Hyposprays now have an internal vial that it uses as a magazine. This can
      be ejected after unlocking the hypospray with a screwdriver. You can still fill
      the hypospray directly if it has a vial in it, which will technically just transfer
      to the vial instead.
  - tweak: You can now add autoinjectors to vial boxes. The research centrifuge can
      now be used to fill autoinjectors. Boxes of empty autoinjectors has been added
      to research.
  - tweak: The research centrifuge will now only fill everything in the centrifuge
      uniquely if the input container has more than one chemical. Otherwise it will
      try to fill everything up.
  - tweak: 'Russian Red can no longer be a chemical component. Reported by Jaio Acex,
      #10603.'
  - tweak: Made the bonemending property more reliable.
  - tweak: The trigger thresholds for mixing explosive and hyperthermic research chemicals
      is now determined by the OD threshold.
  - tweak: Added an alert window to the research data terminal clearance brokerage
      function to reduce accidental purchases.
  UnwaveringGrey:
  - rscadd: Added armor to MP berets. Armor is roughly in line with marine helmets.

      decreased attack speed, slightly increased health.'
  - rscadd: 'Berserker Passive: Bloodrage. You gain a stack of rage whenever you slash.
      Each stack of rage increases your armor, movement speed, and attack speed. Rage
      decays while out of combat. When you reach max rage, you are ''locked'' at max
      rage for 10 seconds.'
  - rscadd: 'Berserker Ability #1: Apprehend. Pick a human target. If you are still
      within 6 tiles of them after 1 second, pull yourself to them.'
  - tweak: This pull does not allow you to bypass wired barricades and other dense
      objects (no noclipping).
  - rscadd: 'Berserker Ability #2: Clothesline. Immediately expend one stack of rage
      to deal moderate damage to and daze a nearby target and fling them back while

      to 2 tiles.
  - rscadd: 'Hedgehog Ravager stat changes relative to base Ravager: Decreased movespeed,
      increased armor, decreased health.'
  - rscadd: 'Hedgehog Ravager Passive: Bone Shards. Your abilities now cost shards
      instead of plasma to use. For each 50 shards you have stored, gain 3 additional
      armor up to a maximum of 300 shards and 18 bonus armor. You gain shards upon
      taking damage and over time.'
  - rscadd: 'Hedgehog Ravager Ability #1: Shard Shield. Expend 200 shards to gain
      a temporary shield. Whenever the shield is damaged, spray bone shards around
      you in a 3x3 AoE centered on yourself.'

      damage, increased health, increased explosive armor.'
  - rscadd: 'Base Praetorian Passive: Corrosive Acid. Your acid-based abilities apply

      blocks one attack and rapidly decays afterward. The shield recharges while out
      of combat.'
  - rscadd: 'Vanguard Praetorian Ability #1: Pierce. You use your tail to pierce enemies
      in a 1x3 line in front of you. If you hit at least 2 enemies, your shield is
      instantly recharged.'
  - rscadd: 'Vanguard Praetorian Ability #2: Dash. Charge through enemies to travel
      at most 4 tiles. You can reactivate the ability immediately after dashing to
      damage targets in a 3x3 grid around you. This also recharges your shield if
      it hits at least 2 targets.'
  - rscadd: 'Vanguard Praetorian Ability #3: Cleave. 2 usable options. If your shield
      is active when the ability is used, the effect is empowered. Option #1: Root

      lower damage.'
  - rscadd: 'Dancer Praetorian Passive: Finesse. For a short time after slashing a
      marine, you have increased evasion. Hitting a marine with a slash applies a
      tag used by your other abilities. Missing a click with your offensive abilities
      adds a short cooldown.'
  - rscadd: 'Dancer Praetorian Active #1: Impale. Attack a marine with your tail.

      human.
  - rscadd: 'Lurker Active #2: Invisibility. Makes you invisible for a maximum of
