      Clues and other places. It will be calculated as a ratio of total points gathered

      done.

      after death.
  - tweak: Objectives now have a guaranteed minimal amount of clues generated. Folders

      alive and they will be worth more points than corpses!
  - tweak: Yautja now also count for containment and corpse retrieval. Happy hunting!
  - tweak: On the flip side, the research containment will now open if the related
