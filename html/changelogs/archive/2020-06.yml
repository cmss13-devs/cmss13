2020-06-10:
  Atebite:
  - experiment: Added a round recorder that tracks player movements and other basic
      information throughout the round.
  Awan:
  - tweak: You can eat food with the z key now. (If you enabled hotkey mode.)
  - tweak: Using Thwei on humans is fixed.
  - tweak: Fax machines have department tags now.
  - tweak: Brig has a crew monitor
  - tweak: SEA has a fax machine now.
  Awantje:
  - tweak: removes hpc damage
  - tweak: Lets hpc be targeted instead of being max range always
  Neth:
  - tweak: Added new ability to Shaman Carrier "Remember Pain(300)". This lets you
      remember amount of xenos near you (non-shaman, expends egg). When you use any
      other ability, if amount of xenos around you is less than amount you remembered,
      you will cast your next ability at remembered power and reset the remembered
      count.
  ThePiachu:
  - tweak: 1st generation synths have been sped up to their later gen counterparts.
  - tweak: Synth self-repair has been sped up.
  - tweak: Changed DEFCON trigger levels to absolute numbers, rather than percentages.
      This means you shouldn't see DEFCON percentages go down unless you are really
      sabotaging yourself. This should also make maps with a lot of civilian corpses
      less of a grind.
  - tweak: Survivors are worth less intel points now.
  - tweak: Xeno containment and corpses are worth different amount of points based
      on their tier. T1 is worth less than before, T3 is worth more, etc.
  - tweak: Intel scanner now points out data terminals. This will help you locate
      them in unfamiliar maps.
  - rscadd: Added a new skill to the game - Reading and Comprehension. It's a skill
      that speeds up processing intel. IOs and all other officers have this skill
      at an advanced level, cutting down their intel processing time by 25%. There
      is also an expert level of this skill (which will be available to IOs at a later
      date once vendor changes come in) to cut down the processing time by 50%.
  - tweak: Mini Intel kits come with a basic reading pamphlet to bring the reader
      to the level of an IO.
  - tweak: Borg recharge stations now repair synths and borgs.
  - tweak: Added objective landmarks to Trijent Dam.
  - tweak: Tweaked Solaris Ridge's objective landmarks.
  - tweak: Added objective landmarks to Sorokyne Strata.
  - tweak: Upped the DEFCON level requirements for LV.
  - rscadd: When fultoned objects drop to the ground they create a new objective -
      retrieve lost fulton. It is worth zero points, but it's a useful way for IOs
      to track lost intel crates.
  - tweak: When the nuclear bomb is turned off, its timer resets to full - Marines
      have to commit to detonating it and not hold the enemies hostage at 30 seconds
      pause.
  - rscadd: Added a command lockout to the bomb. If engaged by the command staff (anyone
      with Bridge access), it makes it so only command staff can toggle safety and
      toggle the timer. This is to limit potential griefing with the bomb timer.
  - tweak: Egg Morpher can now store 12 huggers. Each corpse still produces 6 huggers.
  - tweak: When Egg Morpher is destroyed it spawns some of its huggers around itself,
      like a dying Carrier.
  - tweak: Survivor synthetic now has access to Research by default (since they are
      WY property, and to help on CORSAT access)
  - tweak: Reading pamphlets are not a bit less patronising.
  - tweak: Paper objectives now get a small pixel offset.
  - tweak: Progress Reports and Technical Manuals are now a bit faster to read, especially
      the latter.
  - bugfix: Fixed some runtime errors around smartpacks, defibs, xeno hives, etc.
  - bugfix: Fixed MPs not being able to use some MP lockers.
  - tweak: Intel scanners can now detect detatched synth heads.
  - tweak: Crypod logs now list an area name rather than floor name.
  - tweak: Solaris Ridge DEFCON level triggers have been made harder to complete.
  - tweak: Reduced the amount of unnecessary processing for idle airlocks, disposal
      units and computers. This should hopefully have some positive effect on lag,
      especially on large station maps.
  - bugfix: Fixed double inits of carpets, some other floors and paralysis pen.
  - bugfix: Hopefully fixed some other null runtime error.
  - rscadd: Added Triiodine's sprite to the reading pamphlet.
  - tweak: Vials get a small pixel offset.
  TobiNerd:
  - rscadd: Research can now transmit chemical data to the central WY database. This
      will make that chem exist in the following round, although with a new recipe,
      name and clearance level. The new clearance level and transmisison cost is based
      off the properties of the chem, whereas negative and neutral properties lower
      the cost.
  - rscadd: The CL can now print research grants containing 4 research credits for
      30 briefcase points.
  - rscadd: The CL can now print a chemical report for a new unique chemical at the
      cost of 50 briefcase points. The level of this chemical will be equal to the
      current clearance level of the research department.
  - rscadd: Research can now purchase chemical reports from the research terminal
      for research credits. Higher level reports can be purchased at increased price
      when the respective clearance access has been reached.
  - rscadd: Added the research main terminal to the CMO office. This terminal has
      the added ability to publish documents for all medical personel to see.
  - rscadd: Research publications can be viewed when wearing a Healthmate HUD.
  - tweak: The CMO now spawns with a level 2 chemical report in their labcoat.
  - tweak: All papers can now be added to the research database by clicking a research
      terminal with the paper. This means you can make your own hand-written publications!
  - tweak: You can now read papers from the research database without printing them.
  - tweak: Doubled the strength of the painkilling chemical property. Standard painkillers
      have had their property levels adjusted accordingly.
  - tweak: 'Cryometabolizing now acts as a booster to other properties for half its
      own level. The levels of other properties in cryoxadone and clonexadone have
      been lowered to represent the same healing result with the boost. #11636 by
      Watermelon914.'
  - tweak: Research now starts with 2 credits instead of 1.
  - maptweak: Added a filing cabinet to the CMO office.
  - bugfix: Fixed hyposprays that spawn empty not having a vial inside.
  - bugfix: You can no longer target chems with no recipe in the synthesis simulator,
      such as elementary particles.
  - bugfix: Fixed chem transmitted to the next round not loading properties correctly.
  - tweak: Research chem transmission cost is now minimum 3 credits. WY won't buy
      your garbage anymore.
  Triiodine:
  - bugfix: Fixed M39 brace offset issues.
  - rscdel: 'You can no longer wear health analyzers, magazines, grenades, ammunition
      handfuls, and binoculars on M3 pattern armor suit slots. Unfortunately there''s
      no clean way to change the storage priority for just these items. #8735, #9349.'
  - bugfix: Fixed M39 underbarrel attachment x offset.
  - bugfix: Fixed the missing sec-glasses mask icon.
  - bugfix: Fixed M39 extended ammo offset.
  - imageadd: Changed the hand teleporter sprite to be perspective correct.
  - imageadd: Added new landmark icons for random spawner types and intel spawner
      landmarks.
  - bugfix: Fixed the M44 Custom having worse one handed accuracy, when it should've
      had superior accuracy.
  - maptweak: Removed access to the not-so-secret developer credits room on Sorokyne.
      You can still ghost over and look at it though.
  - bugfix: Fixed the cold water tile blocker that wasn't actually over cold water
      on Sorokyne.
  - bugfix: You can no longer tunnel into the dev credits room on Sorokyne.
  - bugfix: Expanded the tunnel restriction zone down by Glubs on Sorokyne.
  - bugfix: Added the missing door_open icon state for Strata specific doors.
  - rscadd: Increased the amount of nutriment in Boonie Bars, Barcardine Bars, EAT
      bars, packaged burgers, burritos, Kepler Crisps and Chunk Boxes.
  - rscadd: Added more coco to Boonie Bars, Barcadine Bars, and Chunk Boxes.
  - rscadd: Directed some of the salt from Dchat into Kepler Crisps, which now contain
      12u per tube of chips.
  - spellcheck: Renamed EAT bars to MEAT bars, as per canon appearance.
  - rscadd: You can now bash magazines against your helmet to check how many rounds
      are in them. You know, in case you go blind or something and can't use the examine
      verb.
  thepiachu:
  - rscdel: Removed some unused closets from the codebase.
  - tweak: Tweaked how some paper objectives display their messages when they are
      not active.
2020-06-22:
  Awan:
  - tweak: Mentor helps will now repeat.
  - bugfix: Closing the window to pm a player as a mentor no longer closes the mentorhelp.
  - tweak: Fixes being able to catch throwable combi sticks.
  Cakey:
  - rscadd: Added the underbarrel fire extinguisher. Carries the same amount as a
      mini extinguisher, and can be attached to most weapons.
  - rscadd: Flamethrower spec's flamer will now spawn with a default attached UB extinguisher.
  Fourkhan:
  - tweak: 'Buffed: Trapper Boiler, Base Boiler, Base Ravager, Berserker Ravager,
      Oppressor Praetorian, Vanguard Praetorian, M41 Pulse Rifle'
  - tweak: 'Nerfed: Warden Prae, Crusher, Hedgehog Ravager, Warrior.'
  - tweak: Removed Materials Crates (metal and plasteel) from ASRS.
  - tweak: 'Details:'
  - tweak: Warrior grab is no longer a neck grab mechanically (no more oxyloss).
  - tweak: Changed the grab escape code to escape 50% of the time instead of being
      dependent on grab level.
  - tweak: Changed the damage ratio of trapper boiler's acid mine on barricades from
      0.7* total damage to 1.0* total damage.
  - tweak: Increased the damage of trapper boiler's landmine from 50 to 60.
  - tweak: Increased Boiler's view range when zoomed out by 1 tile.
  - tweak: Slightly decreased Crusher's speed at higher maturities.
  - tweak: Increased the bonus damage base ravager recieves from shields from 5% to
      10% of shield HP.
  - tweak: Increased the cooldown of Crusher's shield by 4 seconds at all maturities.
  - tweak: Increased the cooldown of Crusher's charge by 6 seconds at all maturities.
  - tweak: Decreased the damage reduction of Crusher's shield from 12.5 to 10.
  - tweak: Decreased the duration of Crusher's stomp slow from 3 seconds to 1.5 seconds.
  - tweak: Slashing targets as a crusher now decreases your cooldowns by 1 second;
      cleaving a target decreases your cooldowns by .5 seconds.
  - tweak: Decreased the ratio of Crusher's damage applied by cleave from 0.66 of
      total slash to 0.60 of total slash.
  - tweak: Increased Berserker Ravager's armor by 5.
  - tweak: Decreased the self heal of Berserker's clothesline from 200 -> 150.
  - tweak: Added a new mechanic to Berserker Ravager, lifesteal. Berserker Ravagers
      will now heal for (50+5*rage)% of their slash damage whenever they slash a human.
  - tweak: Increased the internal hitpoint gain from hitting a target with a spit
      from 40 to 75 for Warden Praetorian.
  - tweak: Decreased the passive internal hitpoint gain of Warden Praetorian from
      10 to 5.
  - tweak: Oppressor Praetorian's stomp ability now roots marines for 1.5 seconds
      in addition to stunning them.
  - tweak: Added a brief stun to Oppressor Praetorian's tail lash ability; additionally,
      it now slows hit targets for 2 seconds.
  - tweak: Removed the health decrease from Vanguard Praetorian (+40 HP).
  - tweak: Increased the damage of Vanguard Praetorian's pierce ability 50 -> 60
  - tweak: Decreased the cooldown for Vanguard Praetorian's piece ability from 10s
      constant, it now starts at 4.5 seconds and decreases by .5 seconds every maturity
      level.
  - bugfix: Vanguard shield now works as intended and decays over time instead of
      instantly.
  - tweak: Removed Warden Praetorian's extra armor.
  - tweak: Removed Hedgehog Ravager's extra armor.
  - tweak: Removed the mechanic where Hedgehog Ravager could heal by reactivating
      it's shield.
  - tweak: Increased the hit accuracy of the M41Amk2 pulse rifle.
  - tweak: Decreased the spread of the M41Amk2 pulse rifle.
  - tweak: Increased the damage of the M41mk2 pulse rifle by 12%.
  - tweak: Increased the damage modifier of the M46C from 12% additional damage to
      21% additional damage.
  - tweak: Changed the latejoin larva mechanic. Xenos now recieve 1 larva per 4 latejoin
      marines.
  - tweak: Changed the Evolution rate mechanic.
  - tweak: Upgrade rate and Evolution rate are now the same number.
  - tweak: Xenos start at 3 Evolution rate for the first 10 minutes of the game.
  - tweak: After 10 minutes, Xenos gain 1 evolution rate per tick per 30 minutes of
      game duration rounded down plus 0.2*[num evo pods] with a minimum of 1.
  - tweak: Made DEFCON 1, 2, and 3 much harder to get on LV-624.
  - tweak: Made DEFCON 1 and 2 slightly harder to get on Prison and Sorokyne.

      from 3 -> 2.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where Vanguard was immune to explosive damage after it regenerated
      it's shield twice.
  Jeser:
  - tweak: Clicking alive xenomorphs with empty hand on GRAB intent as a human won't
      result in attempt to grab xenomorph and getting stunned. Yautja and Synths are
      unchanged. CTRL + Clicking is unchanged.
  - tweak: Clicking yourself with empty hand on DISARM or GRAB intents as a human
      will check yourself for injuries now.
  - tweak: Point Blanks trigger only on HARM intent now.
  TheDonkified:
  - tweak: Middle mouse click will now allow you to give items to other humans as
      a human.
  - tweak: Middle mouse click will now allow you to climb climbable structures (window
      frames, tables, etc).
  - tweak: MMB hand swapping is still in, just don't click on a human or structure
      object that is right next to you. Xenos that use MMB for abilities will be able
      to use MMB climbing as long as you do not have an ability toggled on.
  - tweak: Added a pref for automatic punctuation.
  ThePiachu:
  - tweak: Overhauled internal logic of how power is handled.
  - rscadd: Added a garbage collector to the game. It's basically a background process
      that will periodically delete junk items from the game to hopefully lower late
      game lag. The items removed shouldn't affect the gameplay - burnt out flares,
      empty boxes, spent casings, literal garbage, etc. It won't remove items from
      your inventory in case you want to hold onto something specifically, and it
      won't instantly delete newly created garbage.
  - rscadd: Added boxes of MREs and flares, so that Requisitions won't have to send
      them down in backpacks. Sprites by Triiodine.
  - tweak: Changed Requisitions crates to use those boxes instead of the loose items.
  - tweak: Changed Large Supply Crates to do the same (you can find one in Requisitions!).
  - rscdel: Removed weapon-specific skills (pistols, shotguns, SMGs, etc.) - they
      were too redundant.
  - rscdel: Removed the Survival skill - it was only used to gate one recipe - molotov
      cocktail. Now everyone can make those! Just use paper on a bottle of something
      flammable.
  - rscdel: Squished a lot of skill levels down to just a handful. They most often
      fall under "untrained / basic training (mini-kits) / trained (combat engis,
      combat medics, OTs, doctors, etc.)". Cut down on snowflake levels for singular
      roles, like Researchers being worse at surgery, or CEs being better at powerloader.
  - tweak: POs' Powerloader skill has been buffed. The only people with a mid-range
      powerloader skill are planned to be PFCs after reading a special pamphlet (not
      in a kit form, but found on colonies around powerloaders).
  - tweak: Some timers have been rebalanced based on the skill changes (like surgery).
  - tweak: Dual-wielding SMGs now has a higher scatter than before (due to removing
      snowflake SMG skill check).
  - tweak: Shipside Synths will have a new role to play in this new skill system.
      They will be more efficient at tasks with timers than even the specialised roles.
      This will mean they can prop up an entire department by themselves, so it will
      be up to the Command to apply them to the right place. Survivor Synthetics are
      not as well trained - they are only as good as a single trained individual,
      but still have the variety of skills to apply themselves anywhere.
  - tweak: The Company has recently launched a colony diversity initiative! Not only
      will the Weston-Yamada colonies not be staffed by clones, they will have actual
      names and distinct features!
  - tweak: Changed the corpse spawner system to use Select Equipment system for loading
      gear, generating names, appearances, etc. This means the generated colonists
      will appear more varied.
  - rscdel: The new USCM protocols have established that walking is now prohibited.
      All personel must either run or stand still, no inbetween! This extends to every
      person and creature in the area of operation, civilian or extraterrestrial.
      (Removed walk intent, it wasn't used anyway, now you will always be running
      and now have to worry about fat fingering walking intent and dying because of
      it).
  - bugfix: Made WO compile again.
  - tweak: Motion detectors should properly disable themselves when a mob dies, gets
      hugged, gets buckled into a nest, etc.
  - tweak: Retrieve corpses objectives should display how many points they earn you,
      not only their completion percentage.
  - rscdel: Removed some unused infrared sight from xenos (we don't use it anyway,
      it's a whole other BYOND feature).
  - bugfix: Fixed some null error around holsters.
  - tweak: Dead people's headsets disable themselves automatically. This is for performance
      reasons. The radios don't disable themselves when you get hugged or nested,
      so you can preserve that gameplay. To re-enable the headset, just open its menu,
      it will turn itself on automatically. Hopefully this will improve late-game
      performance, not having to send messages to 100+ corpses...
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Reduced gun + bayonet damage to slightly below machete level.
  Vicacrov:
  - bugfix: Fixed the hivelord's thick resin door's health. It is now actually stronger
      than a drone's door. (12052)
  - bugfix: Fixed the CMP's ID color. It's now silver as with all commissioned officers'.
      (11879)
  - bugfix: Fixed the Queen not being able to build nests. (12277)
  - tweak: The type of the two roundstart OB warheads are now random. You can start
      with 2 HEs, 2 incediaries, 2 clusters or any of their variations. The number
      of warheads did not change. (12101)
  thepiachu:
  - maptweak: CORSAT's door access has been tweaked a bit to focus more on civilian
      access. Core buttons should still work for Marines not to derail the flow of
      the map.
