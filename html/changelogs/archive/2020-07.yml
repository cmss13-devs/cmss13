  Neth:
  - rscadd: Added language-based above head chat. You can disable it for current mob
      by clicking on Preferences -> Silence Abovehead Chat
  TheDonkified:
  - tweak: Crusher charge no longer causes you to go over unbarbed barricades, window
      frames, etc. It will damage/destroy these things as appropriate.
  - tweak: High toss no longer has a 4 tile range limit.
  - tweak: Xenos can slash through other xenos, tables, unbarbed barricades, etc diagonally.
  - bugfix: Slashing a cade diagonal to you should actually target that cade in the
      event there is nothing obstructing you.
  - bugfix: Throwing items at resin structures should damage them now.
  ThePiachu:
  - tweak: Replaced syringe pouches with medkit pouches for WO doctors.
  - tweak: WO requisition thingies should give proper smartgun ammo instead of just
      powerpacks.
  - bugfix: WO XO uniform should not be honked anymore.

  - tweak: WO Xenos will stay on for a second or two after death to give a little
      bit of a visual feedback of being dead before being deleted.
  - bugfix: WO Xeno final waves will spawn properly now (and will continue spawning
      until -morale- death improves).
  - tweak: WO Synths get their cool smartpack now.
  - maptweak: WO map has been tweaked a bit - there is a second bluespace beaker in
      chemistry, CO's quarters feature their tablet and the M46C gun, there are a
      handful of cryopods in the sleeping bunks, there are some operating tables in
      Triage, as well as some synth recharge stations.
  - tweak: Simplified Tcomms logic - it won't have to bounce through tcomm structures
      to get to your ears, hopefully meaning we'll have less chat overhead. This also
      means Tcomms won't be tied to Almayer (important for WO) - if you have a relay
      tower on the surface you can communicate there, even if Almayer is down.
  - rscdel: Deleted unused communication logic from the various Tcomm machines.
  - maptweak: WO now uses the new Tcomms relay tower.
  - tweak: Tweaked some WO gear for Smartgunners, Honor Guard Squad Leader, doctors
      - they should be more prepared for the round.
  - bugfix: WO Requisition vendors should initialise properly now.
  - tweak: Reduced WO round end variance to be 1 hour 20 minutes plus a random amount
      up to a total of 1 hour 40 minutes.
  - tweak: WO Game Mode will now delete Almayer upon start of the game to remove unnecessary
      processor load. This won't impede Marines on Whiskey Outpost itself.
  - tweak: WO supply grenades will now be easier to use - they will bring up a prompt
      upon activation to pick what type of ammo you want.
  - bugfix: Fixed Souto Man's icon sprites, gun and vehicle.
  - tweak: You can now drag and drop yourself into recharge stations.
  - rscadd: Added some gear presets for Xeno Cultists - basic Cultist dressed in a
      creepy robe, Patriarch dressed in a xeno outfit, and the Midwife - a gen 1 synth
      in a xeno outfit with medical gear. These don't appear in normal rounds and
      are there just for admin events.
  - bugfix: Fixed Predalien sprites not working.
  - tweak: All basic suits can now fit some basic equipment into their HUD slot -
      a flashlight, crowbar, radio, health analyser, oxygen tank and a pen. Armour
      is unchanged and some suits can carry different things on top of the basic equipment.
      This is to make a bigger variety of clothing useful.
  - bugfix: Predator glaive should now properly apply Interference on xenos.
  - tweak: Turned some `twohanded` weapon function paths absolute.
  - tweak: SEAs now have access to MP comms by default.
  - bugfix: Xenos can now hurt Xenos from other Hives / banished Xenos. Turns out
      the bug was around trying to fetch armour for limbs that apparently Xenos don't
      have...
  - tweak: Evilution is now calculated separately for each Hive and updated in the
      UI regularly.
  - tweak: Evilution time bonus is now incremented more granularly by about 0.1 every
      3 minutes.
  - tweak: Xenos can grab all spawned corpses to use for their Egg Morphers. Useful
      for Forward Operating Hives.
  - bugfix: Spawn Pools spawn hive-appropriate larva.
  - tweak: Re-added a short timer for taking over an SSD larva to avoid some race
      conditions and people getting kicked out of larva they just occupied.
  - tweak: Added a new access class for civilians - civilian command.
  - maptweak: CORSAT access has been tweaked a bit - it won't require Corporate access,
      but use civilian command access.
  - tweak: Updated various survivor access to use some newly added access classes.
  - maptweak: CORSAT now has some Powerloader pamphlets around the Powerloader bays
      for those ungas that want to go Ripley on Queen's thorax.
  - tweak: Synth defibbing timer has been extended to give ghosts more time to get
      back into their body.
  - tweak: Defib healing amount has been made flat to that of a doctor skill.
  - tweak: Give Synth skill speed boost to some minor timers around stripping and
      putting items back onto people, tcomms assembly and repair, removing splints.
  TobiNerd:
  - experiment: Reworked the chemical property system backend. All chemicals are now
      processed using properties, not just research chems. On the frontend chemicals
      should be basically unaffected by this, but some chemicals and some properties
      have still received minor tweaks as a result of the rework for the purpose of
      standardization.
  - rscadd: Added the properties hemositic, thermostabilizing, focusing, cardiostabilizing,
      aiding, oxygenating, anticarcinogenic and ciphering. These are tied to specific
      chemicals and do do not spawn during random generation, but they can still be
      used with the simulator if so desired.
  - rscadd: Also added the property electrogenetic, a common positive type.
  - rscadd: Properties now have categories in addition to type and rarity, these are
      medicine, toxicant, stimulant, reactant, irritant, metabolite, and anomalous.

      for an additional 5 credits.
  - tweak: The synthesis simulator now displays the property type.
  - tweak: The boosting property now only affects properties that have an effect inside
      the body.
  - tweak: Many chemicals have received slightly different overdose effects as these
      are tied to the properties.
  - tweak: Overdosing on a painkiller now gives you +50% painkilling, plus the additional
      nasty overdose stuff.
  - tweak: Synthesis targeting a rare property on relation mode now cost 3 times as
      much. Changing anomalous properties costs 10 times as much.
  - tweak: Alkysine is no longer a painkiller.
  - tweak: Halved the gain from the musclestimulating property per level.
  - tweak: Having only positive properties in a chemical now increase all Synthesis
      Simulator operation costs by 1.
  - bugfix: Fixed some inconsistency in how properties were combining.
  - bugfix: 'CL setting clearance to max no longer decrease it when clearance has
      been bought #12239.'
  - bugfix: Fixed rare chemical properties spawning at the same rate as uncommon properties.
  - bugfix: Fixed epinephrine (Electrogenetic) not working.
  Triiodine:
  - fix: Fixed the L42A Battle Rifle rail attachment offsets not actually putting
      attachments on the rear sight mount (That lil protrustion off the back).

  - spellcheck: Fixed the L42A Battle Rifle still being called the L42 Pulse Carbine
      MK1 in the requisitions vendors.

  - spellcheck: Changed USCM intelligence officer pack to USCM lightweight expedition
      pack and rewrote their description.
  - spellcheck: Changed M22 rocket bags to USCM IMP M22 rocket bags and rewrote their
      description.
  - tweak: Buffed Sticky resin health to 45 from 36.
  - tweak: Buffed Fast resin speed up from 50% to 70%.
  - tweak: Nerfed Fast resin health from 36 to 30.
  - experiment: Resin constructions now have variable costs, instead of only 150 plasma
      for Drones and 200 plasma for Hivelords.
  - tweak: Resin doors cost 150 plasma, 175 for thick variants.
  - tweak: Resin walls cost 150 plasma, 200 for thick variants.
  - tweak: Resin membranes cost 125 plasma, 150 for thick variants.
  - tweak: Resin nests cost 125 plasma.
  - tweak: Sticky resin costs 85 plasma.
  - tweak: Fast resin costs 65 plasma.
  - tweak: Resin structures now have 20% improved explosive resistances.
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Reduced gun + bayonet damage to slightly below machete level.
  - tweak: Tweaked melee again. Weed nodes take 1 hit with machete, 2 with bayonet.
      Resin walls take 4 hits with machete, 5 with bayonet. Resin doors take 3 hits
      with both.
  Vicacrov:
  - bugfix: Fixed the hivelord's thick resin door's health. It is now actually stronger
      than a drone's door. (12052)
  - bugfix: Fixed the CMP's ID color. It's now silver as with all commissioned officers'.
      (11879)
  - bugfix: Fixed the Queen not being able to build nests. (12277)
  - tweak: The type of the two roundstart OB warheads are now random. You can start
      with 2 HEs, 2 incediaries, 2 clusters or any of their variations. The number
      of warheads did not change. (12101)
  - rscadd: The Queen can now toggle between two unnesting modes. Default - only drone
      castes can unnest. Toggled - everyone can unnest.
  - tweak: Warriors can now punch infected marines. (12358)
  - rscdel: Instruments have been removed.
  - tweak: 'The white, semi-transparent overlay induced by eye damage was replaced
      with the vision impairment (black square) effect. Currently, it''s not scaling
      with eye damage: you either have it or not. This will be probably changed in
      the future.'
  Watermelon:
  - rscdel: Resin roof will no longer block OBs
  - bugfix: Pylons now effectively block CAS/Mortars within the range that they can
      weed.
  - bugfix: Pylons will no longer leave a roof behind
  thepiachu:
  - maptweak: CORSAT's door access has been tweaked a bit to focus more on civilian
      access. Core buttons should still work for Marines not to derail the flow of
      the map.
2020-07-08:
  Frans_Feiffer:
  - rscadd: Added Gray, Green, and Tan Beanies. These can be acquired via the Marine
      gear portion of the setup character menu. Cargo beanies were made to be inline
      with the rest of the beanies.
  - rscadd: Added Gray, Green, and Tan Balaclava's. These can be acquired via the
      Marine gear portion of the character menu, and can be pulled up/down depending
      on preference.
  - imageadd: Resprited the Coif, the coif can now also be pulled up/down depending
      on preference.
  - imageadd: Resprited Blue, Green, and Purple Surgery gowns/caps.
  - rscadd: Adds Blue and Purple surgery gowns/caps to medbay lockers. (Thanks a million,
      Retrokinesis.)
  - imageadd: Cleaned up the Marine formal uniform.
  - imageadd: Cleaned up Researcher's uniform.
  - imageadd: Resprited the Chief Engineers uniform.
  - imageadd: Resprited VC/PO armor and map variants.
  - rscadd: VC/PO helms now have helmet garbs appear on the onmob sprite just like
      the standard helmet. If it fits in the standard and shows, then it works just
      the same for these helms.
  - rscadd: Added the coif to the gear select menu.
  TheDonkified:
  - tweak: No more RNG when walking over a flamethrower fire
  - tweak: Crusher charge goes over tables and racks again; if a runner can run over
      it, crusher charge will go over it
  - tweak: Flame fire goes through the front of barricades now
  - tweak: Removed armor restrictions from marine uniform
  - bugfix: 'Examining tile contents should now show the tile itself in the list '
  - bugfix: No more pounce dragging
  - bugfix: Larva can no longer bodyblock
  - bugfix: You no longer get transferred to a rolled ERT mob if you get put into
      a new mob (eg got a larva)
  - bugfix: You can no longer pick non-dropship primary LZ locations via the CIC tablet
  - bugfix: You can point at mobs right next to you again
  TobiNerd:
  - bugfix: 'Fixed Quick Clot, Peridaxon, Spaceacillin and Universal Enzyme not having
      an overdose effect (Alardun, #12758). They all now cause brute damage on overdose.'
  - tweak: Paining is now a negative chem property.
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: 'Backend for Pain has been redone. This will hopefully make it more consistent
      and easily tweakable. This may cause issues, so report any weird interactions. '
  - tweak: Removed the hardcoded softcrit, crit and hardcrit values. They now happen
      depending on pain instead of at specific damage levels. Inaprovaline still stops
      oxygen damage at crit and hardcrit.
  - tweak: Removed maturity and its affects. Xeno health and armour has been lowered
      overall, xeno damage lowered by 10%. To counteract this, marine damage has been
      lowered overall by 20%.
  - tweak: Age/maturity is now a fluff indicator of how long a xeno has survived in
      a round.
  - tweak: Queen can now have 4 leaders and loses half of the pooled larva upon death.
      It used to scale with age.
  - tweak: Robotic limbs no longer give damage reduction. This means Synthetics will
      no longer double dip on damage reduction. This may lead to them being too weak,
      open for tweaking.
  - tweak: 'Melee skill now adds 25% extra damage pr. level instead of 20%. '
  Vicacrov:
  - bugfix: Fixed ghosts being able to mess with OT equipment by setting the transfer
      amount/direction of their dispensers, from the afterlife.
  - bugfix: Fixed the G-11 Geothermal Generator's repairing instructions, appearing
      upon examination.
  - bugfix: Fixed the smoke grenade being exempt from the antigrief system. Stop smoke
      grenading briefing.
  - bugfix: Removed some unreachable intel spawns on Big Red.
  - bugfix: Skill or ID-locked containers can no longer be emptied, opened, or otherwise
      their contents removed, if you lack either of these requirements.
  Waltermeldron:
  - rscadd: Added a new gamemode called extended no spawn. In this gamemode, marines
      will not spawn at all and will not be able to latejoin. Might be useful for
      admins doing events that don't involve marines, such as XvX
  - rscadd: Added hive-specific weeds, which will slow you down if you do not match
      their hive. Hive weeds slow down a xeno a lot more than regular weeds. Weeds
      will destroy other weeds if they don't match the correct hive, unless it is
      hive weeds. Xenos no longer regenerate plasma or health when on weeds that belong
      to a different hive
  - rscadd: Added hive-specific walls, which take longer to destroy if you do not
      match their hive.
  - rscadd: Added hive-specific doors, which take longer to destroy if you do not
      match their hive. Larvae and xenos that do not match the hive cannot scuttle
      past or open the door
  - rscadd: Added hive-specific nests, sticky resin and fast resin. Any xeno can unnest
      a nest that does not belong to their hive. Sticky resin will massively slow
      down any xeno that is not of the appropriate hive. Fast resin will only affect
      xenos of the appropriate hive.
  - rscadd: Most xeno abilities will now work on hostile xenos. Stuns will not work
      on big xenos. There are some exceptions, however, such as Queen screech
  - rscadd: Burrower traps will now trigger against hostile hives
  - rscadd: Projectiles from xenos will hit hostile xenos now
  - tweak: Most objects and special structures will now properly resemble the colour
      and the name of their correct hive. This includes eggs and facehuggers
  - tweak: Resin traps can now be destroyed by xeno projectiles, provided that the
      resin trap does not belong to the xenomorph's hive
  - tweak: Eggs will show which hive they belong to upon examination
  - tweak: Eggs can only be planted on their appropriate hive weeds
  - tweak: Queen screech will now affect xenos of different hives
  - tweak: Neurotoxin will now only apply a slowdown to other xenos. No longer will
      it disable your abilities.
  - tweak: Hive-specific special structures can now only be built on their appropriate
      hive weeds.
  - tweak: Xenos now deal more damage to each other now. This also applies to XvX
      projectiles and abilities
  - bugfix: Weed nodes can no longer be planted on hive weeds.
  - bugfix: Queens can no longer overwatch and devolve/banish xenos that do not belong
      to her hive.
  - bugfix: Weeds on walls will now disappear if there is no nearby node.
2020-07-22:
  Awan:
  - tweak: Food icons have been tweaked. They used to be black-nothing-yellow-red,
      in order of hungriness. It is now nothing-yellow-red-black. Yellow is now when
      you need to eat, before getting a slowdown at red.
  - tweak: Removed overeating. It didn't do anything, just allowed you to eat a bit
      extra and lose it instantly.
  TheDonkified:
  - rscadd: Pyro now has a "Fire Shield" that makes them immune to getting burn damage
      and igniting from fire. Other sources, such as WP smoke, incen bullets, etc
      will still be able to ignite the pyro spec while the shield is active. The shield
      lasts 6 seconds with a 15 seconds cooldown.
  - rscadd: The M240T comes with a buffed underbarrel extinguisher with 500 units
      of water and the strength to extinguish xvar flames.
  - rscadd: Specialist abilities can be macro'd. For now, there are only the Specialist-Activation-One
      and Specialist-Activation-Two verbs. Specialist-Activation-One is for scout
      cloak and toggling broiler-T fuel type. Specialist-Activation-Two is for activating
      pyro fire shield. You can still macro the specific verbs for those tools, but
      these specialist ability macros are there so you do not need to keep adding
      them when a new macroable ability is added.
  - tweak: RNG mechanics related to fire damage and ignition of mobs should be removed.
      No more flamewalking (unless you're immune). Fire deals the same damage now
      (no more RNG damage or length of being set on fire). Resisting from fire puts
      out fires at a consistent amount. Values are subject to change.
  - tweak: M240T can be manually reloaded and unloaded as long as you are not wearing
      the Broiler-T back harness. Once you put on the Broiler-T and fire, it will
      automatically eject your current magazine. Behavior when wearing the Broiler-T
      (unable to manually load or unload fuel tanks) is maintained.
  - tweak: Mag harness M240T will automatically snap to your Broiler-T instead of
      your armor slot.
  - tweak: All fire extinguishers fit in the fuel tank strap pouches.
  - tweak: Xenos cannot be healed while on fire.
  - tweak: Moved spec-only verbs to their own unique tabs.
  - tweak: Extinguisher can fit in the fueltank backpack (not the one that the pyro
      spec gets, the one found in the pyro kit/req).
  - tweak: Pyro PFC kit comes with an underbarrel extinguisher.
  - bugfix: Offsets for unbarrel attachments of flamers have been properly set.
  - bugfix: Pyro and people wearing fire suits will no longer receive extra damage
      from simply standing on fire (other mobs/humans would not receive any damage,
      just get ignited).
  - bugfix: Crusher charge can go over window frames again (pending refactor)
  - bugfix: Spitter acid spray can go through mobs again
  - bugfix: Crusher can now go over tables, racks, and the retractable railing to
      req via charge
  TobiNerd:
  - tweak: ACID Harness configuration can now be viewed by anyone using a multitool,
      but the configuration can only be changed by those with medic level medicine
      skill. Research skill is still required to craft the ACID itself.
  - tweak: ACID Harness bloodloss config now triggers at less than 60% blood instead
      of 40%.
  - bugfix: Fixed the synthesis simulator renaming chemicals to Reagent.
  - bugfix: Relating properties that alter other variables in the reagent no longer
      makes those variables go into negatives. It is now reset properly (#12766 Alardun).
  - maptweak: Did a bunch of small mapping tweaks around upper medbay.
  - maptweak: Research lobby is now larger and has been merged with the test lab.
      There's now a chem station in the lobby. The old test lab is now called the
      Research Workshop.
  - maptweak: Research now has one small containment cell and two medium containment
      cells. The last two can be merged into one large cell.
  - maptweak: Did some changes to the CL office and quarters. Quarters now have a
      separate bedroom and there's now a closet connected to the office.
  - tweak: To compensate for the now large amount of chemical dispensers on the Almayer,
      chemical dispensers now use a shared energy pool depending on their network
      (ground, medbay, research, misc). The Turing is not affected by this.
  - tweak: The hypospray lock is now togglable by verb (Toggle Hypo Lock) rather than
      screwdriver.
  - rscadd: Added the medilathe to the research workshop, which can print medical
      related items. Some medical items have been removed from the autolathe.
  - imageadd: Added new science machinery sprites based off old sprites left behind
      by NicBoone, modernised and animated by TobiNerd.
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Synthetics and preds won't stutter by pain anymore.
  - tweak: Human pain thresholds increased. So you need more pain before falling into
      crit.
  - tweak: Runner speed increased. Health decreased so that one PB kills them.
  - tweak: Spitter Frenzy now makes you slightly more faster.
  - tweak: Streamlined building of airlocks, walls and reinforced walls. Examining
      airlock assembly or girders will walk you through the steps. Girder for walls
      and reinforced walls. Airlock assembly + airlock circuit to make airlock.
  - tweak: You can now build fences with metal rods. Wirecutting a fence twice will
      give you back the metal rods.
  - tweak: You can now build window frames with 10 metal.
  - tweak: Airlocks are now deconstructed by welding it, screwdriver to open panel
      and then using crowbar.
  - tweak: Tweaked pain so that it now progresses gradually. If you take a big hit,
      it doesn't jump right to hardcrit, it has to slowly go through all the pain
      tiers. Eventually reaching up at hardcrit. This work both ways, so also when
      you take painkillers. Pain tiers tweaked as well.
  - tweak: Fixed a bunch of pain bugs related to chems and organ damage.
  - tweak: Tweaked Yautja and Synthetic pain to be less punishing.
  - tweak: Fixed a bug where synth borg charger didn't repair pain.
  - tweak: Reduced the Yautja normal and heavy armour bullet resistance. Halved the
      rate Thwei heals brute and burn at.
  - tweak: 'Increased flamers burn damage slightly, rounded to nearest 5. '
  - tweak: Reduced all resin plasma costs by 30. Walls, nest and so on. Order Construction
      plasma cost reduced to 400.
  - tweak: Reduced rifle base melee value so it can't one hit resin nodes.
  - tweak: The grass on CORSAT is now weedable.
  Vicacrov:
  - tweak: Attaching a bayonet to a weapon now makes it a sharp item. (Suggestion
      12544)
  - tweak: Any sharp item can now cut vines.
  - tweak: Command headsets (CO, XO, synth) now start with all four squad channels
      turned on. (Suggestion 12890)
  - tweak: You can now use autoinjectors on yourself by pressing Z, similar to eating
      food. (Suggestion 12789)
  - rscdel: SCPs were removed from the game.
  - bugfix: Facehuggers will now climb back into the egg morpher if they are directly
      on top of it, instead of dying in bulk.

  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Crit is now hardcoded to happen at -50 health again for humans. So you
      go into crit when pain takes you there or when you hit -50 hp.
  - tweak: Painkillers linearly decrease as the pain goes up, so the higher the pain,
      the less effective painkillers. Increased Tramadol and Inaprovaline's painkilling
      effect.

  - tweak: Fixed Incident Summary on JAS not working.

  Vicacrov:
  - experiment: Marine defences were slightly altered. I expect to see more barricades
      to be built and more to be destroyed by the Xenomorphs. Timers were increased
      to avoid cheesy dropping-op-stuff on top of T3s. If these changes lead to tedious
      megaFOBs, Xenomorphs may be given more tools to destroy them. Plasteel cades,
      for now, remain unchanged - I do not want to tweak too many things at once.
  - experiment: 'Metal barricades were tweaked in the following ways:'
  - tweak: Their cost was lowered from 10 -> 5.
  - tweak: Their health was lowered from 450 -> 300.
  - tweak: When destroyed by engineers, they return their full value (10 -> 5).
  - tweak: When destroyed by other means, they return less than half their value (5
      -> 2).
  - tweak: Barbed wires still give +50 health (for 2 sheets, a metal cade of 5 sheets
      has 300 health - it's a net loss, but useful for blocking pounces).
  - experiment: 'The portable composite barricade was tweaked in the following ways:'
  - tweak: Its health was lowered from 400 to 350 (metal cade + barbed wire).
  - tweak: Its deployment time was increased from 0.5 seconds to 2 seconds.
  - experiment: 'Reinforced tables were tweaked in the following ways:'
  - tweak: Its health was lowered from 200 to 140. (They cost 2 metal sheets + 2 rods,
      a barricade built from 5 sheets have 300 health.)
  - experiment: 'Special marine structures were tweaked in the following ways:'
  - tweak: Their deployment time was raised to 3 seconds (from 2 and 1 seconds) except
      for the flag (which remained 1 second).
  - rscdel: Removed the RNG chance of instantly breaking sentries/tesla/etc. They
      now always break below 15% health.
  Waltermeldron:

      whenever a yautja is infected. Can be used to nest a yautja, and can only be
      unnested by a xeno
  - rscadd: Predalien Rework
  - rscadd: (Passive) Gain a token every kill. Deal 1.5x more damage to yautja. Maximum
      of 10 tokens.
  - rscadd: (Ability 1) Leap. Used for quickly jumping over obstacles. Doesn't stun
      at all
  - rscadd: (Ability 2) Battle Roar. Disables the cloaks of everyone nearby and puts
      predator's cloak into a long cooldown. Boosts the damage and speed of any nearby
      xenos, with the intensity and duration scaling depending on the amount of tokens
      the predalien has
  - rscadd: (Ability 3) Smash. Roots everyone in a radius, with the range depending
      on the amount of tokens the predalien has
  - rscadd: (Ability 4) Devastate. Roots an adjacent target in place for a second
      before dealing an immense blow upon them. Damage depends on the amount of tokens
      the predalien has
  - bugfix: Fixed larva not spawning
  - tweak: Intercom pickup ranges have been restored to default on the Alamo and Normandy

      won't display message to those who arrived later or if you moved.
  Vicacrov:
  - tweak: The maximum number of evolution pods were reduced from 5 to 2. Instead
      of 0.2 evo, they now give 0.5. (Evo boost remained the same, but you don't need
      to build that many evo pods anymore.)

      to do the funny sprite changes (ie giant xenos).
  - tweak: RPG no longer has miniscope
  - bugfix: Defenders cannot rest while fortified any more.
  Vampmare:
  - rscdel: Queen minimap over xenos removed. It was not being used enough to warrant
      the extreme performance cost of tracking everything. Xenos have other tools
      to keep track of each other.
  Waltermeldron:
  - bugfix: Fixed overlays on xenos staying when they should not.
  Watermelon914:
  - rscadd: Cultist Leader now has a special icon to show that they are the cult leader

      walls. The same for window frames, except they get destroyed. 10 hits for walls.
      3 hits for window frames. 5 hits for reinforced window frames.
  - tweak: Girder cost is now 2 metal instead of 5. Window frame is now 5 instead
      of 15.
  - rscadd: You can now build reinforced window frames with 5 plasteel.
  Vicacrov:
  - experiment: Survivors received the following update. This is part one of ??? who
      knows, but they need more updates than this.
  - rscadd: Added the following preset - Engineer. It is the only survivor having
      engineer (2) level construction (plasteel cade, windows, etc). Similar to the
      Miner, they can also operate Powerloaders.
  - rscadd: Added the following preset - Gang Leader. It is a leader-type survivor
      on Prison Station. They have less melee than Prisoners, but they gain two levels
      in the leadership skill.
  - rscadd: Added the following preset - Trucker. It is the only survivor having crewman
      (3) level vehicles, meaning they can operate the APC/tank and their weaponry.
      (Life is dangerous in the outer rim.) However, they cannot operate the powerloaders.
  - rscdel: The following survivor presets were removed from the game - assistant,
      atmos tech. They did not fit our gameplay anymore. (Rip atmos.)
  - rscdel: The following survivor presets were removed from the spawnpool (but can
      be still manually applied by staff) - botanist, civilian, salesman. They did
      not have a meaningful toolset to help you surviving.
  - rscadd: 'The Engineer has the following skills: engineering (2), construction
      (2), medical (2), endurance (5), powerloader (2).'
  - rscadd: 'The Gang Leader has the following skills: engineering (2), construction
      (1), medical (2), endurance (5), cqc (1), firearms (1), leadership (2).'
  - rscadd: 'The Trucker has the following skills: engineering (2), construction (1),
      medical (2), endurance (5), vehicles (3).'

  - rscadd: The Trucker can appear on Ice, LV-624, Solaris, and Trijent.

      Too few bullets for too many xenos.

      backpack instead of your waist.
  - tweak: Survivors now spawn with weapons on Prison Station as well.
  - rscadd: Survivors now spawn with either a double barrel shotgun or an M41A MK1
      on their waist. They only have one mag for it.
  - rscadd: 'A new item spawner was added: survivor ammo. Anywhere - not near the
      hive - there is a chance that 3 (in total) boxes of buckshot / M41AMK2 mags
      spawn across the map. Luck will be probably not on your side, though.'
  Waltermeldron:

      to them.
2020-07-31:
  NethIafin:
  - bugfix: Fixed Shaman Carrier not giving shields to other xenos.
  - tweak: Completely reworked Boxer Warrior skillset.
  - rscadd: Boxer Warrior passive - KO Counter. Every hit against same opponent builds
      up KO counter. Slashes and disarms give 0.5 counter, while Punch and Jab give
      1 counter. Changing target or not attacking target for 5 seconds will reset
      the counter. This includes abilities and usual attacks.
  - rscadd: Second Boxer Warrior passive - Clarity. Boxer warrior can shrug off limited
      number of adverse effects (like daze and knockdown) before those effects can
      actually do something to it. Boxer Warrior starts with 6 stacks of clarity and
      regenerates one point each minute. Uppercut regenerates Clarity based on how
      much KO points they have.
  - rscadd: Jab - 4 seconds cooldown. Range 3 ability that Boxer can use to reduce
      distance. On hit it does not deal damage, but slows and dazes target for 2 seconds
      (assuming 0 Endurance). It also resets Punch cooldown.
  - rscadd: Punch - 4 seconds cooldown. Range 2 ability. On hit it deals same amount
      of damage as usual warrior punch, but does not break bones. This ability also
      pushes target 1-2 tiles away from you, and resets Jab cooldown.
  - rscadd: Uppercut - 10 seconds cooldown. If you are near your target you will automatically
      hit them. On contact it will put your Jab and Punch on cooldown, reset your
      KO counter and heal you for 5% of max hp times the KO counter. It will also
      do following effects if the KO counter is high enough (all of them is KO counter
      is bigger or equal to 9)
  - rscadd: If you have at least 1 KO point during Uppercut it will deal 15 damage
      per KO point
  - rscadd: If you have at least 3 KO points during Uppercut it will knock back target.
      This knockback scales with KO points and will deal damage if target hits wall.
  - rscadd: If you have at least 6 KO points during Uppercut it will knock down the
      target for 3 (or more) seconds (assuming no Endurance). This scales with KO
      points.
  - rscadd: If you have at least 9 KO points during Uppercut, target will be slept
      for 10 seconds and will be completely out cold.
  - tweak: Boxer max Clarity nerfed 6 -> 3.
  - tweak: Boxer Clarity regen delay reduced from 60 seconds to 15 seconds.
  - tweak: Uppercut no longer restores Clarity.

  - bugfix: Fixed Boxer getting frozen in place (stunned) by explosives while Knockdown
      was absorbed.
  TheDonkified:
  - experiment: Tackles are no longer purely RNG. A system has been implemented for
      minimum and maximum tackles. This is 100% subject to adjustments/complete redo.
  - experiment: You must have at least MIN tackles in order to land a tackle. If you
      reach MAX tackles, you are guaranteed a tackle. Each caste has a tackle chance
      CHANCE, and the tackle counter resets after 4 seconds.
  - experiment: 'Boiler, Crusher: MIN=2, MAX=6, CHANCE=25%'
  - experiment: 'Burrower, Carrier: MIN=2, MAX=4, CHANCE=50%'
  - experiment: 'Defender, Warrior: MIN=2, MAX=4, CHANCE=35%'

  - experiment: 'Queen: MIN=2, MAX=6, CHANCE=55%'
  - experiment: 'Ravager: MIN=2, MAX=5, CHANCE=35%'
  - experiment: 'Sentinel: MIN=2, MAX=6, CHANCE=50%'
  - experiment: 'Spitter: MIN=2, MAX=6, CHANCE=45%'
  Waltermeldron:
  - rscdel: Predators have a reduced slow effect applied to them.
