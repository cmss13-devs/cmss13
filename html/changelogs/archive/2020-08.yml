      if opened on WO map and won''t show regular jobs that don''t have respective

      M41A MK1 (reported to be underperforming)."'
  - rscdel: '"There are no more random M41A MK1 ammo spawns, only boxes of buckshot."'
  - tweak: '"The boosted early game evolution for Xenomorphs to combat the early marine
      deathball vs young T3s was halved (x4 -> x2) as the T3s evolve with full strength
      now. Xenos get T3s in about roundstart + 14 minutes. (1218 under normal circumstances.)"'
  - tweak: '"The Almayer dropships'' and the monorail''s first deployment lockdown
      timer was changed from 1215 to roundstart + 15 minutes. (1219 under normal circumstances.)"'

      Their secondary weapon is still randomized."'

2020-08-07:
  NethIafin:
  - rscadd: Added new strain to Runner - Acider. They lose all standard runner abilities
      and are a bit slower than standard runners (about lurker speed)
  - rscadd: Acider Passive - Acid Storage. Every time Acider Runner is hit, they gain
      Acid equal to amount of health lost. Acid is also gained (although very slowly)
      with time. Max amount of acid is 1000
  - rscadd: Acider Passive - Acid Slashes. Any Acider melee attack applies an acid
      on their target and if target was already covered with acid, some amount of
      acid will be added to acid storage while acid stack on enemy will be regained.
      This acid can be used by Spitters to activate their acid wave explosion.
  - rscadd: Acider Active 1 - Corrosive Acid. Spend 100 acid to cover barricade, item
      or vehicle with boiler acid. The application of acid is 4 times faster than
      usual.
  - rscadd: Acider Active 2 - FOR THE HIVE! Prepare yourself to sacrifice for the
      hive. Can only be activated when above 200 acid is stored. This changes color
      of the runner and initiates a sound loop that notifies surrounding hostiles.
      After 20 seconds Acider Runner will explode covering all barricades in area
      (acid/100) with normal acid (won't melt reinforced barricades, usual barricades
      will survive only if repaired at the same time), all enemies with acid stacks,
      and deal up to 200 burn damage to all enemies in the radius (damage tapers off
      at max range). If Acider Runner gets killed during this ability, nothing will
      happen and explosion will be cancelled. If Acider Runner survives and ability
      activates, after 3 seconds Acider Runner player will get a free (at no cost
      to the hive) larva if hive has spawning pool. Acider runner can cancel this
      ability by using it again, but this will set Stored Acid to 0
  - tweak: Acider Runner no longer gains Acid by taking damage. The only way to gain
      acid now is waiting and slashing someone with acid on them.
  - tweak: Acider Runner speed increased (still less than normal strain runner).
  - tweak: Acider Runner For The Hive! max acid spread reduced to 5 tiles. Burn damage
      spread is same.
  - tweak: Acider Runner For The Hive! now is superslowed instead of being slowed
      (0.75 delay increase to 1.5 delay increase).
  - bugfix: For The Hive! is now bound to action 3.
  - bugfix: For The Hive! cannot be activated while resting or knocked down.
  - bugfix: For The Hive! should now properly put you into new larva

  Waltermeldron:
  - tweak: Decreased Queen defuse timer for nukes from 15 seconds to 5 seconds
  - rscadd: Changed the Big Red CL spawn to spawn in as an R&D Assistant Manager.
      They outrank the CL, but belong to a separate division; they cannot and should
      not give orders to the CL.
  - rscadd: Assistant Managers and above can increase the clearance to 5-X with no
      purchase required.
  - experiment: Corporate Liaisons can now get a rank up to Executive Specialist depending
      on their playtime as a CL. See below for the playtimes.
  - rscadd: (0 hours) Junior Executive. (16 hours) Executive. (32 hours) Senior Executive.

      box.
  - rscadd: Added misc and non-standard boxes to cardboard build list. Fixed naming
      of other boxes.
  - rscadd: 'Changes to ammunition boxes: transferring rounds is now a series of timed
      actions where 40 rounds are transferred every 1.5 seconds. That means extended
      and big magazines like M41AE2 will take longer to refill than before. Clicking
      ammunition box with appropriate magazine on HARM intent will start transferring
      rounds from magazine to the ammo box.'
  - soundadd: 'Interactions with magazines and bullets such as: taking bullets out,
      filling magazines manually and from ammunition boxes are now accompanied by
      new sounds.'
  Tobinerd:
  - bugfix: Fixed fire chems stacking their base values with their modifiers, making
      them either super powerful or super weak in different areas. Things are normalized
      again now.

      before the flame update. Numbers will be on the wiki.

      turfs more and made the burncolor of UT-Napthal Fuel a bit brighter.
  - tweak: There's now a hard limit for how many corpses that can spawn per map at
      round start. This should decrease lag on maps that had a high amount of corpse
      spawns.

      spawners instead.
  - experiment: Put Sorokyne Strata back into normal map rotation.

      look, though you can't get them back once you do! Only works for standard Squad
      Marine uniforms.
  Waltermeldron:
  - rscadd: Fueltanks can now be reinforced with 5 metal sheets. Using crowbars will

2020-08-18:
  Jeser:

      storage briefcase, escape pod panels, old vending machines.'
  Waltermeldron:
  - bugfix: Fixed the zombie species, as well as the presets.

      verb.
  - tweak: Adjusted numbers related to fire stacks. Extinguishers still work the same.
      Custom flames will work differently.
  - tweak: DURATION = how long fire lasts and how many fire stacks you get when lit
      on fire, INTENSITY = how much damage you get on direct hit and plays a role
      in damage from being on fire.
  - tweak: 'Note: fire stacks are capped out at 45, so you cannot have higher than
      45 fire stacks at a given time.'
  - tweak: 'Pyro greenflame: DURATION = 60, INTENSITY = 15 (INTENSITY was nerfed from
      20)'
  - tweak: 'Pyro blueflame: DURATION = 40, INTENSITY = 40'
  - tweak: 'Napalm: DURATION = 20, INTENSITY = 30 (INTENSITY was buffed from 20)'

  - tweak: Alien resists remove 10 stacks. Alien extinguishing pats remove 5 stacks.
  - tweak: Hunters resists remove 25 stacks. Extinguishing pats remove 10 stacks.
  - tweak: Human resists remove 10 stacks. Extinguishing pats remove 10 stacks.

      and 95% chance to miss on knocked down hunters).
  - tweak: When trying to tackle a Hunter, the min and max tackles are increased by
      2 for each caste.

      Council request.

      to be a mutineer and Begin Mutiny, which'll start the mutiny, and make the mutineers
      more visible.

2020-08-26:
  Lengord:
  - imageadd: Added full and half full states for backpacks, coding by Vampmare.
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Reworked the IFF backend. IFF is now based on the shooters faction and
      the ID on the human hit/not-hit. For performance reasons, the IFF faction is
      reset once a magazine is loaded instead of each shot, so if you pick up a random
      gun with IFF, reload the same magazine to make sure it matches your faction.
  - rscadd: The ID computer can now add and remove IFF for factions. You can only
      add and remove factions the authorized ID has.
  - tweak: Survivors spawn with survivor and marine IFF.
  - bugfix: You now have to be an observer to return to your nested body when it is

  - bugfix: Staff will no longer break MapDaemon by manually delaying the round.
  Vicacrov:
  - tweak: Added a check to hijacking. The Queen can no longer hijack without at least
      half of her hive being onboard.
  - tweak: Raised the specialists' armor storage slots from 2 to 3, to be in line
      with regular (light, medium, heavy) armors.
2020-08-27:
  TobiNerd:
  - maptweak: Replaced snow tiles on Corsat with the less laggy autoturf variant.
  - maptweak: The airlocks into Omega from Gamma and Theta are now 4 tiles wide and
      the walls surrounding them are now destructible given there's no space between.
      The ceiling is too low for vehicles to enter Omega through the Gamma and Theta
      airlocks.
  Vampmare:
  - bugfix: Fixed Flak not behaving correctly. The bullet will now have IFF as usual.

2020-08-28:
  TobiNerd:
  - experiment: Decreased the number of items physically located on maps by merging
      them into tables and racks.
  - experiment: Placing most items on tables or racks will now merge the item into
      it. However, the items should remain as interactable as usual. Holding CTRL
      while clicking a table or rack with an item will force the item to be placed
      on the table, rather than trying to click an item on the table.
  - bugfix: Fixed pixel accurate item placement on tables (yes, apparently we had
      this but never noticed because it was bugged).
  - tweak: You can now open storage containers with middle clicks as an alternative
      to drag and drop. Opening a storage container on a table or rack MUST be done
      using middle click.
  - tweak: If you want items on a table listed you should use ALT click.
  - tweak: To prevent people from accidentally flipping tables from muscle memory,
      you now need to be on harm intent to flip a table.
2020-08-29:
  Jeser:
  - bugfix: Fixed new ammunition sounds playing for shotgun ammo boxes.
  - tweak: Undeployed ammo boxes sprites now have small offsets.
  - rscadd: Added ammo boxes path option for Quick Create Object.
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Adjusted all the spec armour stats. They're now medium armour, but better
      in two stats. Grenadier remains the same. Demo, faster and more bomb resistance.
      Scout, faster and melee resistance. Pyro, acid resistance and internal damage
      resistance. Ghillie, faster and acid resistance.
