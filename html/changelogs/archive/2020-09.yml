  Waltermeldron:
  - rscadd: Pred limit now scales with population
2020-09-02:
  Jeser:
  - tweak: 'If job gets slot opened, it will stay open for the rest of the round now,
      whether current population satisfies slot unlocking requirements or not. Reason
      why this was changed in a simple example: player gets spawned as Squad Specialist,
      but 20 minutes later has to go to cryo. However, by this time, a dozen or two
      marines have died and amount of alive and active USCM personnel humans is lower
      than required for 4th Specialist slot to be opened. This results in slot being
      locked. In most cases, for the whole round.'

  - rscadd: This item can convert ammo into rubber bullets by hitting them with the

      each other anymore. When ramming into multitile vehicle, both vehicles' last
      movement direction and momentum are taken into account and damage taken by vehicles
      is increased respectively.
  - tweak: Vehicle skills requirements for Tank and APC were icnreased to Crewman
      level.
  - bugfix: Fixed Toggle Gyrostabilizer verb not working.

      3 and 4 rounds, respectively.
