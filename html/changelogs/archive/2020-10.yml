2020-10-03:
  Carlarc:
  - tweak: Defender fortify is now set to Xeno-Primary-Action-Four, and the HUD button
      was moved to be the last button.
  - tweak: M44 custom spawns with marskman ammo, since the SEA and RO m44 belts are
      full of marksman ammo only, it didn't make sense for it to be loaded with normal
      ammunition.
  - tweak: Moderators+ now bypass timelocks instead of only admin+.

  - tweak: Tweaked the time that the heal overlay for praetorian heal stays for and
      tweaked the colours.
  alardun:
  - rscadd: Ordnance Canister now come with an activable Blast Wave Dampener. This'll
      drastically increase the rate at which the explosion falls off past 2 cells.
      Could be useful for extremely focused explosion or to limit friendly fire. Note
      that Mortar and Rocket casings must be toggled on the warhead itself, not the
      full assembly.
  - bugfix: Transfering a reagent to an Hypospray now displays the correct value.
  - bugfix: Anti-parasitic no longer increases the speed at which the larva grows,

  - bugfix: Thanatometabolizing efficiency is now governed by blood loss, rather than
      blood remaining.
  - tweak: A Research Chemical cannot roll only default medical chemicals for its
      component, since that causes untold mayhem for the medics when it randomly reacts
      in the body.

  Triiodine:

2020-10-14:
  Vampmare:
  - tweak: Reworked the RoleAuthority and rolling of roles. Special roles are now
      rolled with everything else, this helps with balancing and some other backend
      stuff. First a fake rolling of marines are done, to get a approx number of roundstart
      marines. Then xeno pop is calculated based on that. Then roles are actually
      rolled depending on priority, with xeno first, then command then everything
      else in that priority.
  - tweak: Xenos now get 1/5 xeno to marine ratio roundstart. Smallhosts are spawned
      with a 1/20 host to marine ratio. Every 4th late joining marine gives 1 xeno
      larva. This should help balance out the lowpop to highpop differences and make
      it more fair across the board.
  - tweak: Changed xeno to marine roundstart ratio to 1/4.
2020-10-15:
  Carlarc:
  - rscadd: SMG has recieved BIG changes!

      speed, equal to m41a. In addition, the wield slowdown has been reduced to be
      as slow as worn light armor.
  - tweak: To counteract this, it has increased scatter, damage falloff, and reduced
      accuracy.
  - tweak: This means it wil be powerful in close range, fine at midrange, and weak
      at long range.
  - tweak: M39 AP has been tweaked to be more AP and less damaging.
  - tweak: M39B/2 buffed to go along with the m39 buff.
  - rscadd: When a warrior fails a lunge, its hands will twitch as a feedback message.
  - tweak: Facehuggers are facehuggers now

      of the default noncursive black.
  - rscadd: M4A3 Hollowpoint reworked!
  - rscadd: M4A3 HP deals roughly 33% more damage, but is much less effective against

      Will improve performance at the cost of memory.
  Waltermeldron:
  - tweak: Nurse is no longer timelocked.
  alardun:
  - rscadd: Added the possibility of an ID lock to bags and satchel. It may be toggled
      via an ID card, and prevents opening/emptying/picking up the locked bag. This
      lock may be overridden by characters with Command Tablet access.
  - rscadd: Added the M63A1 bag to the Heavy Grenadier Specialist kit. This bag can
      only carry grenades, and features an ID lock.
  - rscadd: 'Added jagged shrapnels. They have significantly more chance to cause
      shrapnels in humanoid, and slows down Xenomorphs for 0.2s per shrapnels hit. '
  - rscadd: 'Added the M74 Airburst Grenade (AGM-F: Airburst Grenade Munition - Fragmentation).
      It''s a GL/UGL-only grenade that spray shrapnels in a cone in the direction
      it landed toward. The grenade detonate upon stopping (so they can rebound).
      They use jagged shrapnels as projectiles, and a direct hit causes a significant
      slow down for 1.5s (in addition to the shrapnels hitting).'

  - tweak: The Grenadier specialist belt now carries 2 HIDP and 1 HEDP less.

      price as HIDP. They are also available as a choice for Specialists
  - tweak: The Underslung Grenade Launcher now lobs grenade (like the M92). It however
      requires the usage of both hands to fire and had its capacity reduced by 1.
  - bugfix: Shrapnels no longer have a 100% miss chance against their originator (e.g.
      whoever threw the grenade). This means hand-thrown HEFA or M15 are significantly
      more dangerous if you're within the shrapnel radius.
  - tweak: The M92 now count down remaining grenades each time it fires.
  callunaborealis:
  - bugfix: Horizontal acid holes are now shown again for vertical wall turfs after
      being melted by xeno acid. It now uses the correct icon and allows xenos to
      pass through a vertical wall turf. Previously all acid holes were vertical regardless
      of the wall turf.
  - tweak: Xenos will now know the direction of the acid hole being created through
      the chat prompt when generating acid onto a wall.

      easier time hitting the sides of the cone. Direct impact still only does 5 shrapnels.

  Waltermeldron:
  - tweak: M92 can no longer hold the miniscope attachment.
  alardun:
  - rscadd: 'Trapper: Boiler Trap is empowered by gaining 10 stacks of Insight. These
      stacks are acquired by hitting Acid Shotgun pellets, at a rate of 1 for 1. Hitting
      a rooted target with Acid Shotgun immediately gives 10 stacks. These stacks
      cannot go beyond 10, and are consumed upon casting Empower Boiler Traps.'
  - rscadd: 'Trapper: Empowered Boiler Trap increases the root duration by 1.25 seconds,

      an Acid effect on humanoids and 78.75 damages to barricade. However, it takes
      0.65s longer to land, for a total of 2 seconds. It also uses a different overlay
      to indicate the additional danger.'
