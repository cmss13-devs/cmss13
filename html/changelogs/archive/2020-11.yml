  - experiment: 'General vehicle changes:'
  - rscadd: Vehicle Crewmen get +1 tile vision when buckled to vehicle seats to compensate
      3x3 vehicles nature. This means hostiles can't attack vehicles in range without

      by rangefinder functionality.
  TheDonkified:

      being listed still need to be looked into.
  TobiNerd:
  - rscadd: When using the Synthesis Simulator in AMPLIFY, SUPPRESS or RELATE mode,
      you now get 3 options for the new recipe component. The chosen component will
      either replace one of the existing recipe components or be added as an additional
      component. If you choose to add a rare component in this way you get 1 credit
      refunded.
  - tweak: Tweaked the value of some of the neutral properties.
  - tweak: The Synthesis Simulator will now display the expected new OD threshold
      of a chemical before running the simulation.
  - experiment: Added a new mode to the Synthesis Simulator, CREATE mode. This mode
      allows researchers to create a new chemical from scratch.
  - rscadd: When creating a new chemical, researchers get to choose the properties,
      OD, name, and the rarity of recipe components.
  - rscadd: The cost of creating a new chemical is based on all of the following.
      The level of each property, the number of property slots used, the OD level
      and the rarity of each component. Basic, common, uncommon and rare components
      add a +7, +4, +1 and -5 modifier to the cost respectively. Negative properties
      and most neutral, depending on the value of the property, decrease the cost
      rather than increase it. A penalty cost is added for each property above level
      5 (+1 at 6, +2 at 7, +4 at 8, +5 at 9, +7 at 10). The minimum cost of creating
      a chemical is 5 credits.
  - rscadd: The properties ATX, ACR, NGN, HPX, TXC and CRS are available for creation
      mode at round start. Scan chemicals in the XRF analyzer to make more properties
      available. Anomalous properties can not be added via create mode.
  - wip: CREATE mode does not take into consideration whether the properties you enabled
      might conflict and cancel each other out. So don't try this, you'll just waste
      your credits.
  - bugfix: Fixed an old bug with how we check if a recipe already exists. This was
      why researchers more often that they were supposed to, ended up with recipes
      of 4 or more components and why the simulator seemed biased towards adding more
      rare components.
  Unknownity:
  - bugfix: Synthetic survivors are now able to access the USCM Synthetic vendors
      again.

      (Fill each container sequentially with the mixture).
  - rscadd: Added a reagent tank to Medbay Chemistry and two in Research containment.
  - rscadd: Added a new type of pouch, available in medic vendor, as well as a few
      in medical lockers, or produced at the medilathe. It is a reagent container
      with a capacity of 480 that can be refilled at reagents storage tanks and machinery
      and can refill custom autoinjectors (and only them). It also has space for one
      injector. The medic pouch is prefilled and also comes with one custom 15x6 injector.
      Thanks Dismas for the sprites.
  - rscadd: Vial boxes can now tile-pickup vials and injectors from the floor.

      enter a cloak-like state. Your collision is removed (you still can get shot
      by non-friendly projectiles), you become near-invisible, and you enable Aimed
      Shot. Moving breaks the cloak entirely, and shooting make you more visible for
      5 seconds. The shooting visibility debuffs stack and only resets once you stop
      firing for 5 seconds.'
  - rscadd: 'Ability 2: Aimed Shot. Can only be used while in full stealth. Display
      a lock-on on the target and channels for 1.25 seconds, then automatically fire
      at the target if the bullet has a chance to connect (No turf/blocking structure
      in the way/ Line of sight is still there). The shot is homing, though somewhat
      dodgeable if you can get an obstacle in time. If the shot connects with the
      intended recipient, the projectile does a critical hit, described below.'
