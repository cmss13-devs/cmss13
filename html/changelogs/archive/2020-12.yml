      fire support using its C4 to breach through walls and barriers, and automatic
      machine gun to deal high damage in an immediate effect and area.
  - rscadd: 'The M2C Heavy Gunner Kit comes with 2 sticks of C4, a tool pouch with

      creating breaches in fences, cades or doors, a M10 Technician Helmet to shield

      M56D; it comes with full automatic fire capability and higher damage and rate
      of fire but less AP than the M56D, along with a more flexible and reactive tripod.
      However, it also has a debilitating overheating mechanic which limits sustained
      suppressing fire, or long-term engagements with its limited ammunition supply.
      Furthermore, it cannot be built near cades (adjacent tiles) in a 3x3 bubble,
      encouraging aggressive placement and positioning. '
  - rscadd: 'Adds special sound effects for the M2C HMG, including a shooting, overheat-cooling,
      rotating, reloading, ammo ejecting, and disassembling effect. '
  - rscadd: 'Adds sprites for (dis)assembled and destroyed M2C HMG, ammo box sprites,

  - tweak: Electrogenetic properties is now consumed at a static 1 per revive attempt,
      rather than a value equivalent to the level. In other words, Epinephrine now

      a 15 tile range from where the impact turf. Second message has a 10 tile range
      from the impact turf.
  - tweak: The first mortar warning message is no longer the size of the OB warning
      message, however it is still red, bold, and contains the underline.
  - bugfix: CAS, OB, and mortar messages should appear if you are standing on the
      tile of impact now.
  Vanagandr:
  - rscadd: Hypospray reworked, autoinjectors tweaked.
  - bugfix: Bug with attempting to remove unlocked hyposprays from inventory pulling
      the vial out fixed. Bugs with hyposprays filling from any reagent container
      fixed.
  - tweak: Hyposprays and autoinjector sfx are a bit more audible now. Emergency autoinjectors
      now have a very distinct sfx.
  - rscdel: Hypospray unlocked state made default, vial lock removed. Autoinjectors
      no longer have a vestigial vial lock verb.
  - imageadd: Hyposprays now have in-hand sprites, an unloaded sprite, and a window
      on the side displaying their contents.
  - tweak: Hyposprays can have their dose changed between 5u (current), 10u, 15u,
      and 30u. They can be alt-clicked to switch between these settings.
  - tweak: Examining a hypospray now displays its vial and remaining reagent volume,
      if any, and its current dose setting.
  - rscadd: The hypo now handles much like a pistol; hold it and click it with an
      empty hand to remove the chemical vial; hold an unloaded hypo and click it with
      a vial to load it.
  - rscadd: If you have medical skills, you can click a vial with an unloaded hypospray,
      or click-drag a vial to an unloaded hypo, to perform a 'tactical reload'. This
      will transfer the old vial into your other hand, or drop the old vial on the
      ground if your hands are full.
  - rscadd: The hypo can still be filled without removing the vial; it fills like
      any other beaker or flask, including pill dissolving, reagent tanks, and transfers
      from other vials. Of course, you can't transfer chemicals into a hypospray that
      doesn't have a vial.
  - rscadd: The top-up port has a one-way valve; if you want to remove reagents from
      a hypospray, either syringe it or remove the vial.
  - rscadd: For the most part, this is all *additional* functionality - you can still
      use it in the same way you did before without any problems.
  - rscadd: I've tested this repeatedly and it all works as expected, but if you notice
      hypos or autoinjectors behaving strangely, @ me.
  Waltermeldron:
  - rscadd: All assemblies have been changed to use tgui.
  - tweak: Fuel tanks can now be detonated whilst reinforced. They still cannot be
      shot/flamed/exploded to detonate, they must be manually detonated or they must
      react with an explosive chemical. Exceptions are for very large explosions (e.g.
      OB).
  - tweak: It now takes 10 plasteel to reinforce a fueltank.
  - bugfix: Fixed timer and proximity sensor.

  - tweak: landmarks refactored to speed everything up
2020-12-18:
  Carlarc:
  - rscadd: Buffed Defender.
  - tweak: Reduced crest toggling cooldown to two seconds. Toggling crest now also
      lowers speed twice as much and increases mob size, meaning lowered crest defenders
      resist stuns the same way hivelords and carriers do. You can now headbutt with
      lowered crest as both strains.
  - tweak: Changed how headbutt works significantly. Headbutt deals 20 damage with
      5 penetration to the chest, only works next to the target, and pushes the target
      away 3 tiles. Lowered crest headbutt has a 3 tile homing range and deals 30
      damage with 5 penetration to the chest, but pushes only one tile away.
  - tweak: Tail whip ignores barricades and now does the *tail emote.
  - tweak: Increased defender health and explosion resistance by two tiers, removed
      slash damage variance.
  - bugfix: Fixed tail whip costing plasma even when not actually activating.
  - tweak: Steel crest reduces normal damage by 5, increases headbutt damage by 5,
      pushback by 1. Buffed steelcrest fortify's resistance to mostly default fortify
      levels, but at the cost of a slower movespeed.
  - tweak: Default strain defenders in fortify resist stuns. Steelcrest defenders
