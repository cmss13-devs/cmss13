      the nailgun. It is pistol-sized and fit in a backpack. Thanks to Thwomper and
      monkeyfist101 for the sprites and audio!
  - rscadd: The nailgun fires armor-piercing nails with stats similar to the M39 AP
      rounds, with a similar ROF, though with no burst. It has slightly higher falloff

      the target for 3 seconds. You cannot have your frozen duration reset while already
      immobilized.
  - rscadd: Using the nailgun on a wall or reinforced wall sporting a hole will fix
      it after 6 seconds at the cost of three sheet of wood/metal/plasteel, and 12
      nails and a 6s channel. It also restores 5% integrity.
  - rscadd: Using the nailgun on a damaged wall or reinforced wall will repair integrity
      at the cost of 1 sheet of material and 4 nails, 2 second channel. Wood repairs
      5%, metal repairs 10% and plasteel repairs 20%.
  - rscadd: 'The above applies to wooden barricade, folding barricade, barricade and
      plasteel barricade. This can be used to fix barricade below the welder threshold.
      Wood on wood : 100%, Metal on folding, metal barricade: 20%, plasteel on folding,
      metal barricade: 25%. Plasteel on plasteel barricade: 20%. This consumes 4 nails
      and 1 unit of material and takes 2 seconds.'

  Vanagandr:

  - bugfix: Toggling HUDs for ghosts once again works.

  - tweak: Re-enabled rsc preloading because it is currently disabled and we don't
      have CDN enabled (this means we're having to dynamically send resources over
      to clients after they've joined, which also means everything they see will be
      black when they first join prior to this change)
2021-01-23:
  Firartix:
  - tweak: ASRS manifests are now cooler and hold extra information
  - tweak: ASRS spawning reimplemented to be less quirky and more generic

  - tweak: Hijack surge's pooled larva cooldown is now a minute and a half, reduced
      linearly over time up to a minimum of 30 seconds after 20 minutes.
  - tweak: 'The reason behind this is because while the spawn pool currently punishes
      hell-holds, it also punishes basically everything: Either your push needs to
      instantly break the xenos or you get overwhelmed. Making it incremental, and
      break surge on destruction will give a incentive to pushing without punishing
      it.'
  - tweak: ERT shuttles' transit period and distress signal calling delay are now
      30 seconds.

  - bugfix: DNR marines will be flagged as *Deceased* immediately on view crew manifest
  Sigil:
  - bugfix: Default req claymores can be planted again.
  - tweak: You can now deploy mines without detonators, although they still won't
      actually do anything. So check that there's an assembly inside before planting.
  TheDonkified:
  - bugfix: Scopes should properly remove their buffs from a gun after unscoping via
      a UI button or a verb.
  - bugfix: Fixed how evolving calculates the number of open slots.
  - bugfix: Hive status displays the correct number of T2s and T3s now.
  - rscadd: Queen can no longer be gibbed.
  - tweak: Hive status displays the amount of guaranteed slots left.
  - tweak: Hive status will now update every 2 seconds when queen is alive and every
      10 seconds when queen is dead.
  - tweak: Converted spaces to tabs in the hive_status.dm file.
  - bugfix: Reverted an accidental hidden buff that made T3 slots equal to 25% of
      the total hive count rather than 20%.
  - bugfix: Fixes stat panel options menu.
  - tweak: Modified the formatting of the statbrowser tabs. Verbs should no longer
      have weird line spacing and the spacing between verbs and categories is reduced.
  - tweak: Can now set the fontsize for the contents of statbrowser tabs, but not
      the tabs themselves.
  - tweak: Added HTML_FILE define for when you're directly writing out an HTML file

      be one or two if you are using it correctly).
  - tweak: Status panel for observers shows DEFCON level.
  Vanagandr:
  - rscadd: Weapons set to burst can now be fired point-blank.
  - rscadd: The burst will track the target as long as you remain within one tile
      of it. If you move apart, any remaining shots in the burst will lose lock and
      be fired normally towards its most recent position.
  - rscadd: While the first shot in a PB is still perfectly accurate, subsequent shots
      in a burst check accuracy as usual. At PB range, this mostly only matters to
      people trying to onehand massively inaccurate weapons. Shotgun pellets still
      count as the first shot.
  - rscadd: Missed PB burst projectiles fly safely into the ground or ceiling -- unless,
      as mentioned above, you move apart. If the target is prone and you move away
      from it, the fact that the bullets are not tracking it means that they will
      fly over its head.
  - rscadd: Pointblank behaviour is based upon the bullet fired, bonus damage against
      prone targets, and an inconsistent damage buff that depends on which specific
      gun you're using. If a gun does not do something on a normal hit, it won't do
      it on a PB.  Unless the ammo is specifically coded to do so, I.E. the nailgun
      or battlefield execution. Buckshot stunning on point-blank is a characteristic
      of buckshot, not point-blanks.
  - bugfix: Attempting to PB with an unloaded gun now goes *click*. Will hopefully
      clear up some "Why didn't my gun go off?" situations.
  - bugfix: Firing an underbarrel shotgun from an unloaded gun should no longer display
      *click* unnecessarily.
  - bugfix: A bullet flyby sfx was using the wrong filepath, and should now be audible.
  Waltermeldron:
  - tweak: Toned down the sizes of some messages.
  - tweak: Mentor chat can now be filtered by unticking the `Mod Chat` option

  - rscadd: 'Added CLF M43 Holdout Pistol in Personal Cosmetics. The case comes with
      1 loaded pistol and 1 additional magazine. '
