  Waltermeldron:
  - rscadd: Sets up the repository to work well with deployment with docker.
2021-03-02:
  Firartix:

  - bugfix: Fix up area flags handling that were causing issues eg. with Burrower.
  - tweak: Exosuit fabricators now print robot heads that can't be used for cyborg
      construction.

  - bugfix: Fixed selection menu for Overwatch Insub and Squad Transfer
2021-03-04:
  Firartix:
  - bugfix: Timers in mob status handling now actually delete properly instead of
      erroring.
2021-03-05:
  Segrain:
  - bugfix: Firesuits and spacesuits no longer grant unintended immunity to pounces.
2021-03-09:
  TheDonkified:
  - bugfix: Full auto works on black tiles now.
  - tweak: M2C will rotate upon click now instead of requiring you to fire first.
  Waltermeldron:
  - bugfix: Changes the bikehorn notification message to an actual sound file.
  - rscadd: Adds the Xenomorph and Marine techtree. Xenomorphs can enter through the
      verb in their alien tab called "Enter Tech Tree" and marines can enter through
      the verb in their "Objects" tab.
  - rscadd: Each techtree has 3 tiers. Marines get 3 different permanent techs per
      tier and some repeatable techs that can be purchased multiple times (req points/OBs).
      Xenos get 2 different permanent techs and 2 different powerups each tier. Powerups
      can be purchased multiple times to provide different temporary/limited use abilities
      and effects.
  - rscadd: The tech tree controller for the marine side is chosen randomly between
      the CO/XO. The controller can choose to hand this power to the other side if
      they so choose using the tech management console in CIC. They cannot be forced
      to give up this power and additionally cannot be forced to purchase any techs
      if the controller is either the CO/XO. If someone else is in control of techwebs,
      a person of a higher ranking may take over by going to this console and using
      it. Leaving the almayer z-level will result in the person in control of techwebs
      to lose their control - You must be on the Almayer z-level to control techwebs.
  - rscadd: Adds a new role called RT Operator. This is a squad role and there is
      2 per squad. The assistant RTO is the second RTO in a squad to spawn in. The
      squad lead succession operates as so; SL -> RTO -> Assistant RTO
  - rscadd: Added telephones. RTOs get a portable telephone on their backpack.
  - rscadd: Added droppods. Drop pods are a way of distributing techs. More drop pods
      (manned drop pod, etc) may be added in the future with this change. RTOs can
      call down any tech drop pods. Drop pods will gib anything they land on.
2021-03-10:
  Carlarc:
  - rscadd: Survivor starting number is now readied players divided by 10.
  - rscadd: Slugs have been reworked slightly.
  - tweak: Slug maximum range is now 8 from 16. Accurate and stun range is 6 from
      12.
  - tweak: Slugs no longer daze or debuff T3s at all, instead, they have gained almost
      double damage and increased penetration.
  - tweak: Removed miniscope from the HG, MOU53, and M39 as they are counter to the
      weapon's design.
  - tweak: The reasoning behind these changes is that slugs are an unfun weapon to
      fight and they heavily shut down and can in fact stunlock T2s and T1s, primarily
      warriors and spitters, in a 1v1 and lock down lanes at any range, which a single
      marine should not be able to do with a common ammotype and weapon. This is a
      problem because it is one of the things stacking power onto t3s and combat queen,
      forcing lower tiers to sit in the back, either sidelining or waiting for evo.
  - tweak: Slugs no longer daze, instead, they have gained almost double damage and
      increased penetration.
  - tweak: The reasoning behind these changes is that slugs are an unfun weapon, they
      piss off xenos heavily. In addition, they heavily shut down T2s and T1s, primarily
      warriors and spitters, in a 1v1 and lock down lanes at any range, which a single
      marine should not be able to do with a common ammotype and weapon. This is a
      problem because it is one of the things stacking power onto t3s and combat queen,
      forcing lower tiers to sit in the back, either sidelining or waiting for evo,
      and encourages holding chokes instead of pushing out.

      (they still suck though).
  - rscadd: Gave the Ordance Techs more buckets and 4 M3-VL armor sets in an emergency
      locker in their office. The buckets are on the racks next to the locker.

  forest2001:
  - tweak: Changed some staff logs to send to appropriate people.

      ammo. This is because the loyalty implants are non-binding and are only relic
      holdovers which cause confusion for players.
  - wip: The above is a temporary fix due to mapfreeze. The lockbox will be repathed
      to indicate it's contents, and I'll look at making a better "loyalty lockbox"

      The ceramic plate has been changed to be very durable against regular marine
      bullets and can last a lot longer than metal plates when it comes to resisting

      forever.
  - tweak: The NVG implant becomes ineffective after you die 2 times with it implanted.
  - tweak: Buffed the self-revive implant significantly. It will now activate whenever
      you are supposed to enter crit and completely heal all damages (not including
      bonebreaks and organ damage). It has been renamed to Rejuvenation Implant.
  - tweak: Endurance stimulant has been changed to a 1-use autoinjector that injects
      5u into your body. It has been buffed to immediately heal all organ damage and
      bone breaks, whilst making you immune to any further organ damage/bonebreaks
      for an additional 5 minutes. It also still has muscle-stimulating and nerve-stimulating
      (albeit nerfed), as well as immense painkilling. It has been renamed to redemption
      stimulant. The OD threshold has been changed to 5u.

  - soundadd: Adds two sounds for bolt action-based effects, and a firing sound for

      fix a barricade at less than engineer skill takes twice as long.
  Carnage0681:
  - tweak: Acid Runner health increased to 330, from 230.
  Firartix:
  - rscadd: Added default classic keybindings based on previous CM13 keybinds
  - tweak: 'Typing indicator was modified to allow for original faster client-side
      handling - it will now display the typing bubble for 5 seconds regarldess of
      prompt being open. '
  - tweak: Removed skin Hotkey Toggle as it conflicts with new system's Hotkey Mode
  - tweak: Added Quick Equip Keybind, renamed previous ones to Unholster

  Vanagandr:
  - tweak: Removed attack_speed delay when clicking one item with another when in
      storage (backpacks pouches etc.). Delay varied based on attacking item.
  - tweak: Reduced delay when putting items on tables/racks. Delay varied based on
      item, is now 0.2 seconds.
  - tweak: 'Removed extra delay when picking up an item not in first-layer inventory
      (in backpack, on table, on floor etc.). Total delay was 0.6 seconds, is now
      0.2. The pickup verb 0.8 second delay was not changed. '
  - tweak: Removed extra delay when clicking things in inventory with an open hand.
      If an item in pocket, clothing, opening a pouch etc. total delay was 0.05 seconds,
      now 0; if drawing item from fast-draw toggled pouches etc. total delay was 0.25
      seconds, is now 0.2.
  - bugfix: Clicking the inventory spacers in slotless storage items (satchels, backpacks,
      some boxes) now behaves exactly the same as clicking the item sprites directly.
      With the item-removal click delays now 0.2s across the board, the main effect
      of this is that you can't pull things (M15...) out of your satchel while resting
      or in a xeno stomach.
  - bugfix: Can't attempt to throw stuff at objects inside storage items anymore.
  - bugfix: Updated mob/../carbon attackhand to add the attack delay to the *attacker*
      rather than the victim. Originally they all had this code but humans and xenos
      were updated to their current state while /carbon was left unchanged. Being
      punched/disarmed should no longer add action delay to you. Note that this is
      for human -> human or human -> xeno attacks with an open hand; this had nothing
      to do with xeno -> human attacks.

      means cades will be weaker against acid spits and bullets.
  - tweak: Acid spraying a cade coats it in acid.
  - soundadd: Slamming into a barricade or unpounceable human (shields, hunters) causes

      plasma cutter, but those are just map flavour at this point as far as I can
      tell.
  - bugfix: Fixed the torii arch on some maps. While it could be message spammed with
      a flame source, it could not actually be lit. It was also banged on during lighting
