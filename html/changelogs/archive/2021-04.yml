  Firartix:
  - experiment: limited concurrent async rustg requests in flight from DBQM Controller
  Lengord:
  - rscadd: Added RTO ringing sprites
  Segrain:
  - bugfix: Deconstructing sandbag barricades once again yields correct quantity of
      sandbags.
  Vanagandr:
  - rscadd: Numerous changes to storage items, mostly cosmetic.
  - rscadd: Accessing a storage item now visibly opens it, if it has open/close sprites.
      Closing the inventory window also closes the item. This applies to backpacks,
      satchels, belts, pouches, G8s, first-aid kits, pill bottles, and the vehicle
      internal storage locker. Looks pretty good generally; a bit weird on first aid
      kits, but the consistency is worth it I think.
  - rscdel: An item that can't be dumped out will no longer show an unusable Toggle
      Tile Dumping verb.
  - tweak: Attempting to empty an already empty item now fails. Didn't make sense
      you could keep dumping it out over and over when there was nothing in it.
  - tweak: Activating a storage item in hand will attempt to empty it automatically,
      if that's possible. If it's empty and can be folded, activating it will attempt
      to fold it.
  - tweak: You can no longer spam storage opening sounds.
  - tweak: Inventory storage now closes when you die, to prevent cute bugs with items
      that suddenly pop closed when the owner finally gets around to ghosting or logging
      out.
  - tweak: Opening/closing vehicle storage lockers plays SFX.
  - tweak: Renamed storage 'close()' proc to 'storage_close()' so that looking for
      the damned thing in the code isn't like pulling teeth.
  - rscadd: You can now dump pills from one pill bottle to another. Just click on
      one while holding the one you want to dump out.
  - imageadd: Adds open/closed overlays for pill bottles. Also shows when empty.
  - rscadd: The pistol pouch now visually displays holstered guns.
  - tweak: The UPP knife pouch spawned with 10 knives but could only hold 5. Modified
      it to be loaded with 5 UPP bayonets instead of the usual throwing knives, in
      line with what appeared to be the original intention.
  - tweak: Gunbelts adjusted - ones that can take both automatic pistols and the M44
      now use different sprite coords for each, vastly improving appearance. Tweaked
      mortarbelt base coords.
  - tweak: Extended when-equipped mouse opacity changes (letting a click anywhere
      on its 32x32 area count as a direct click) on belts to include belts worn on
      armour (gunbelt only, I believe) and the G8 pouch generally, which for whatever
      reason is not actually a Belt-type item.
  - rscadd: Lockable backpacks open when clicked like other packs, and when doing
      so display an unlocked overlay whether locked or not.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Smartpack not properly displaying contents overlays.
  - bugfix: Fixed the delay in opening a worn backpack running twice.
  - bugfix: Fixed dead people being able to spam attempts to empty inventory items.
      It didn't dump out, but did send messages.

      sprite, if it has one.
  - tweak: Floorbots and secure storage code tweaked and cleaned up a little.
  - spellcheck: adjusted description text for many pouches, backpacks, belts, scabbards.
      Particularly some belts where the M276 description had been copied but insufficiently
      tweaked. Also fixes a couple typos elsewhere.
  - bugfix: Pill packets no longer show lid overlays.
  Waltermeldron:
  - rscadd: Moved the phone UI to a separate TGUI panel.
  - bugfix: Fixed phones hanging up on launch.

  - bugfix: Fixed phones runtiming as soon as they spawn in.
  naut:
  - bugfix: Alcohol is no longer deadly in small doses.
  - tweak: 'Alcohol no longer gives you effects past slurring: blurred vision, random
      movement and passing out has been disabled.'
  - tweak: Threshold for slurring from drinking alcohol increased to 300 from 180.
  - tweak: Alcohol now metabolizes faster, at the rate of oxycodone (15u metabolized

      XENO_NO_DELAY_ACTION, or half-delay. Error messages have no delay. This does
      mean 'You can't do that!'-type messages are spammable, but only the user can
      see those.
  - rscadd: A missed xeno melee attempt now has a half-delay and audio-visual feedback,
      plus a message. Should make the true causes of 'eaten clicks' more apparent.
  - rscdel: Xenos can no longer click tiles to attack mobs in them. The functionality
      still exists but is now accessed indirectly through directional attacks and
      the next change. Weeds & blood etc. often blocked this anyway.
  - tweak: As a xeno, clicking your own sprite now attacks the tile underneath the
      mouse pointer. This means that you will no longer miss otherwise-viable attacks
      because your own dummy thicc sprite got in the way.
  - tweak: If conducting a tile attack where you and a prone enemy are on the same
      tile, it will now attempt to target the enemy rather than the standing mob (you).
  - rscdel: 'Nibbling allied xenos removed: no attack delay for harm-intent clicking
      them.'
  - bugfix: Timed xeno actions (as distinguished from ability actions) such as tipping
      vending machines etc. now apply delays when they *start*, rather than when they
      finish.
  - tweak: Attack delay for missing a directional attack is now 0.25 seconds, down
      from (usually) 1 second.
  - tweak: Directional attacks now calculate angles more precisely, so your mouse
      doesn't need to be perfectly lined up to attack in a cardinal direction.
  - tweak: The non-help intent self-harm preference toggle doesn't apply to xenomorphs
      anymore, as they can't do anything to themselves unless someone someday gives
      them weapon items. This prevents the toggle from messing you up when you click
      your own sprite while trying to attack someone.
  - tweak: Changed the layer of the residue left by an abandoned ovipositor so that
      it's above weeds and weed nodes.
  - rscadd: Added xeno attack animation to slashing resin, resin nests, dropship chairs,
      claymores, broken powerloader wreckage, discarded ovipositor object, empty eggs,
      resin fruits, tipping vending machines.
  - tweak: Only attacks on mobs add to xeno slash stats. Previously all xeno clicks
      did, making it a useless statistic.
  - tweak: Xenos no longer need to be on harm intent to open lockers.
  - tweak: Xeno snow clearing must be done on disarm or grab intents, as harm intent
      counts as a missed slash and help intent does nothing.
  - tweak: Clicking resin structures (spikes, sticky resin etc.) on help intent applies
      no delays.

  Carlarc:
  - rscadd: Added a parry mechanic to the Clan Sword. When activated the predator
      will glow a bright white and deflect bullets/riposte melee for 3 seconds on
      a 8 second cooldown. Marines can attempt to parry, but it won't be very reliable.
  - rscadd: Combistick reworked. You must hit an enemy once before being able to throw
      it, and then the charge will be spent. A hit + throw combo deals roughly 40
      damage.
  - rscdel: Removed combistick yanking cooldown.
  - tweak: Increased aimed shot cancelled cooldown and delay slightly.
  - tweak: Increased aimed shot delay from 1.25s to 1.5 + 0.1 seconds for every two
      tile to the target.
  - tweak: If a aimed-at target goes into cover, add half cooldown to your next shot.
  - rscadd: Added an admin preset for spawning USCM snipers.
  Firartix:
  - tweak: Staff logging in will now give a notification, similar to logout
  - tweak: Player and Staff access logging is now tied to client and not mob Login/Logout,
      and won't trigger on mob changes constantly (eg. xeno evo)
  - bugfix: new_player logins are not logged twice anymore
  - bugfix: occupied stasis bags now are visually layered similarly to laying down
      persons (avoiding misplacement of sad players eg. under medevac)
  - tweak: Refactored dropship attach points and FM gimbals in preparation for CAS
      Weapons rework
  naut:
  - tweak: All instances of 'Weston-Yamada' have been replaced with 'Weyland-Yutani'.
  - tweak: In reference to above, similarly, all instances of 'W-Y' have been replaced
      with 'Wey-Yu'.

  QuickLoad:
  - rscadd: Added sensormate HUD purchasable by RTO in gear vendor.
  - rscadd: Added two new ESSENTIAL sets to the RTO vendor, which include a sidearm
      of choice, ammo, laser binoculars, and signal flares to help the RTO in their
      JTAC role for CAS.
  - rscadd: Added three relevant sidearm ammo choices for purchase from the gear vendor.
  - tweak: Changed RTO insulated gloves to be marine insulated gloves.
  - tweak: Streamlines the RTO vendor for better loadout experience, less button mashing,
      more relevant options in relevant places.
  - rscdel: Removed now redundant or irrelevant options such as helmet selection,
      machete, sidearm selection, GLTD etc.
