  - rscadd: 'Ravager: Visual indicators for empowering, scissor cut and super-empowering
      (Empowering with 3 or more tragets)'
  - rscadd: Slightly increased charge CD reduction per slash. (Experimental)
  - rscadd: 'Super-empowering and slash buff are now based on targets nearby instead
      of shields, and the former gives the following effects for 5 seconds:'
  - rscadd: 'On Empower: Charge tramples + slashes on hit, Scissor cut superslows.'

  - tweak: You can no longer attach armour plates to suit/armor type clothing (bulletproof
      vests etc). No different mechanically as they only function when attached to
      a uniform, but it prevents confusion.
  - bugfix: Removed duplicate message when attaching armour plates to uniforms.
  - bugfix: A human who is buckled to a bed or goes prone no longer has rotated chat
      text. Other transforms will still mess it up if they don't countertransform
      the langchat image, but resting/buckle is the main chat bug.
2021-05-03:

  - tweak: Admirals now get alternative uniform options in the dress vendor.
2021-05-04:
  Jackie_Estegado:
  - tweak: Added delay to deploying inflatables.
  forest2001:
  - rscadd: Added volume levels for certain radios. They cannot currently be changed
      by the user. Heads of Department and certain special radios will now broadcast
      in large text regardless of leadership skill. Important radios, such as SL,
      RTO, PO and Command Radios will now broadcast in slightly larger text than normal
      unless leadership level is higher than the volume.
2021-05-05:

      a more viable flank option.
  - maptweak: Moved the grow platforms at Kutjevo Botany entrance to the center, shortening
      the choke. It should be a more dynamic push.
  - maptweak: Widened the east stone bridge into Kutjevo Botany Bay. Widened the Kutjevo

  - imageadd: Edited sprites for flashbang cluster and for M40 stun grenade.
  - rscadd: 'Added event version of flashbangs: M40 stun grenade. Policing skill isn''t
      required to use grenade and neither grenade effects are affected by it. Knockdowns
      only within 3x3 area, applies temporary blindness, deafness and daze with varying
      strength based on distance to target. Xenos only get dazed and deaf. Lying down
      significantly reduces flashbang''s effect.'
2021-05-07:
  50RemAndCounting:
  - tweak: Changed all mentions of "Submissive" xenos hive in code to "Tamed"
  Frans_Feiffer:

  - tweak: Improved buildmode logging
  Jackie_Estegado:
  - tweak: Windows destroyed by thrown objects now generate fingerprints.
  - tweak: All types of windows now generate fingerprints.
  TheDonkified:
  - tweak: The rejuvenation implant no longer gives brain stimulants. Instead, it
      gives you the redemption stimulant. It also gives only 0.5 units of speed stimulant
      instead of 3 units.
  - tweak: 'Halved the amount of time for weeds to grow (10->5 seconds) and for weeds
      to decay after their nodes are destroyed (20->10 seconds). '
  - tweak: 'Explosions deal between 2%-10% of their severity as damage to weeds instead
      of RNG based on damage thresholds. '
  - tweak: Upped normal weed health from 1 to 5. Boot knives and bayoneted guns should
      still one-hit normal weeds, but non-bayoneted guns and other items with force
      less than 15 will no longer one-hit normal weeds.
  - tweak: Weed nodes start out with the same health as normal weeds. When they expand
      fully (or cannot expand any further from a confined space), they "grow" to have
      their standard health.
  Triiodine:
  - maptweak: Fixed some rockwalls behind the latest Kutjevo expansion.
  naut:
  - rscadd: Resprited a few objects n' such.
  - imageadd: Upgraded defibrillator now has a red color scheme to differentiate it
      from the regular defib.
  - imageadd: Ladders have been resprited. Alpha added inside the ladder rungs in
      order to make them more easily clickable.
  - imageadd: Implant injectors resprited. Difference between unused and used sprites
      is now more noticeable.
  - imageadd: Resprited the implant itself. Now looks more CM-ey.
  - imageadd: USCM logo on status displays now flickers occasionally.
  - imageadd: Resprited incendiary buckshot to have its own sprite rather than the
      'custom color' variant used currently.
  - imageadd: Military Wardens (MW) now have their own icon on the SecHUD.
  - tweak: Medic CZSP kits now have all of their contents in the box itself. Upgraded
      kits are no longer located in their own box.
  - tweak: Changed names of hud.dmi to make it work with the Warden.
  - tweak: Modified descriptions of Medic CZSP items.
  - tweak: Defibrillator code tweaked. Defibs now flash red when they're out of battery.
  - tweak: Code on incendiary buckshot has been modified to use the new sprites rather
      than the old.
2021-05-09:
  Segrain:
  - bugfix: Quickly storing items in helmets no longer leaves their ghosts to haunt
      you.
  - bugfix: Defibrillators no longer waste a charge when the patient is no longer
      valid by the end of procedure (e.g. revived by somebody else or expired).
  - bugfix: Defibrillators now can actually use all of their charges, including the
      last one.
  Vanagandr:
  - bugfix: Fixes click delay bug I introduced with inserting items into the inventory
      screen of worn/carried storage items (belts etc) and internal storages (webbings,
      spec GL). Putting things into a worn/carried storage item should not be affected
      by action delay; taking items out should.
  - tweak: 'Due to a code simplification, interacting with an item in a storage item
      using another item applies action delay again, if the storage isn''t in your
      inventory. Example: pouring liquid into a beaker which is inside a satchel.'
  - bugfix: Tables and racks are now 'transparent' for the purposes of adjacency checks,
      IE it calculates as though the item were sitting on the same tile as the table.
      This fixes a bug I introduced with not being able to insert items into the inventory
      screen of a storage item on a table (surgery tray) and probably fixes something
      else somewhere also.
  - tweak: 'Click delay for interacting with tables+racks moved to their code, rather
      than being checked for by all clicks. Additionally, the 0.2s delay is now specifically
      for putting items on surfaces, rather than also applying to interacting with
      items which are on a surface. Example: pouring liquid into a beaker which is
      on a table.'
  forest2001:
  - tweak: Repaths (almost) all Hunter weapons
2021-05-10:
  alardun:
  - tweak: Adjusted movement functionality slightly to standardize how the direction
      is set between directional keys and left-mouse. There shouldn't be any impact,
      but notify me if going around barricade becomes weird.
  - rscadd: Added Xenomorph damage overlays. Xenomorph now shows damage when their
      health drops belows 75%/50%/25% health, with them dissapearing if healed.
2021-05-11:
  Carlarc:
  - bugfix: Fixed inability to switch between activable abilities while incapacitated.
      In practice, this means you can switch between lunge, fling, etc. while stunned
      as a Xenomorph. It is possible but unlikely this means some abilities might
      unintentionally be usable while incapacitated.
  Segrain:
  - bugfix: Poor wooden tables are now visible in every shape.
  ghostsheet:
  - bugfix: Fixed flares not being activated properly.
2021-05-15:
  NeroCavalier:

      huggers will return immediately if there is no one to jump to.
2021-05-16:
  Avalanchee:
  - maptweak: 'Expanding the painfully tight eastern nightmare insert chokepoint on
      LV624 and adding more breathing space for both sides '
  Carlarc:
  - rscadd: 'Added tip of the round. Suggestions for new tips welcome in the #ideasguys
      discord channel.'
  Firartix:
  - bugfix: Fixed sniper pre-equipped loadout overriding generic spec's, breaking
      it in character preview and some admin ERTs
  John:
  - tweak: All Xenomorphs, excluding runners, lurkers, and the Queen, have had their
      health increased by 25%.
  - rscadd: Added more Xenomorph health tiers.
  John_Titor_Back_Again:
  - tweak: Xenos that were buffed prior with the 25% health buff is being tuned back
      by roughly 15% leading to an effective health increase of about 10%.
  - tweak: Praetorian has seen a nerf of 5% Health from prior buffs, and Ravager a
      5% health increase.
  - tweak: Crusher keeps its 25% Health increase for now, subject to change.
  - tweak: Maths went wrong, health actually as intended now.
  Lumdor:
  - tweak: Changed the minimum timer for the assembly timer from 2 seconds to 3 seconds.
  - tweak: Changed the skill required to modify explosives to engineer master.
  NeroCavalier:
  - tweak: Removes oxycodone from rejuvenation implant
2021-05-17:
  alardun:
  - tweak: Reduced aimed shot time from 1.5s + 0.05 * tile to 1.25s + 0.05 * tile.
  ghostsheet:
  - bugfix: Resin holes will no longer be hidden by purple sacs.
2021-05-18:
  Carlarc:
  - imageadd: Resprited the wielded sprite of the NY-762, holdout pistol, b92fs, CMB
      revolver, pk-9, and automag.
  - imageadd: Added m4a3-like slide-back icons for the b92fs and automag.
  - imageadd: Added sprites for b92fs, automag and holdout pistol magazines.
  - imageadd: Restored the MP7 magazine's sprite.
  Vanagandr:
  - rscadd: Alt-click now directly takes items from carried or worn inventory items
      which can have Storage Drawing Method toggled or have direct drawing set. This
      includes webbings, machete/shotgun scabbards, gunbelts, pouches, labcoats, and
      marine armour, among others.
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a gunbelt with a gun in it will draw a non-gun item if possible.
      Includes smartgunner and mortar belts.
  - tweak: 'Uniforms with webbings attached can no longer be put into inventory storage,
      in line with the webbing itself. '
  - tweak: Adds and applies 'isgun()' type check shortcut generally.
  - bugfix: Fixes bug where gunbelts would jam up if the gun inside melted or was
      otherwise deleted.
2021-05-19:
  Benbot16:
  - rscadd: Research now passively gains points over time, at a rate of 5 points every
      10 minutes.
  - tweak: Randomly generated reagents are more likely to be better.
  - tweak: The Synthesis Simulator can only modify randomly-generated reagents.
  - rscdel: 'The CL can no longer print research-related papers. '
2021-05-20:
  Carlarc:
  - rscadd: The last 1.5 seconds of super-empower halve your glow, giving you a warning
      before it fades.
  - tweak: Refactored empower mobs in range check to be more performant, hopefully
      will help with reported lag.
  - tweak: Defender headbutt now does 30 damage, 20 if crest lowered.
  Segrain:
  - bugfix: Inserting magazines/attachments into guns no longer makes the gun shoot
      you.
  Vanagandr:
  - bugfix: Fixed click delay preventing you from putting things into webbing/armour
      storage screens. I have written this thrice now, and what I tell you three times
      is true.
  spookydonut:
  - bugfix: Make colony cameras init on their own colony network
  - bugfix: Protect colony and overwatch camera networks
2021-05-21:
  Cakey:
  - bugfix: Fixes runtimes caused by chemical overdose related deaths
  Segrain:
  - bugfix: Activating medkits to open them and pill bottles to take out a pill no
      longer dumps the entire container onto the floor.
  - bugfix: Toggling the light on worn smartpack no longer dumps its contents either.
  - tweak: Overhauled code for magnetic harness. No functional changes.
  - bugfix: Quickdraw from gunbelts once again works.
  - bugfix: Wallmounted storages in vehicles work again.
  Vanagandr:
  - tweak: Being shot while wearing a ceramic plate now has the impact flash effect.
  - bugfix: The nailgun can now PB-staple mobs to surfaces or inflict superslow at
      angles other than the cardinal, and detects those surfaces much more consistently.
      Anything bigger than a T1 was and is exempt.
  - tweak: Modified PB backend a bit for efficiency, shouldn't have any visible effect.
      Any issues would probably be with the under-extinguisher failing to fire, but
      testing shows no issues.
  - rscadd: Attachable guns now track their own last-fired time, fixing them sometimes
      having enormous fire delays when activated after firing the host gun. This also
      means firing an underbarrel attachment doesn't put the main gun on cooldown.
  - bugfix: You can now extinguish yourself or others using melee clicks with an activated
      underbarrel extinguisher.
  forest2001:
  - tweak: Changed the icon pathing for Hunter equipment and weapons due to the sheer
      number of sprites involved.
  - wip: If any icons are missing please ping @forest2001#2001 on discord and I'll
      make a hotfix ASAP.
  - rscadd: Added the ability to change armour material, this alters its visuals.

2021-05-23:
  Cakey:

  - bugfix: Mobs will now correctly track their total kills again.
  Carlarc:
  - tweak: Did some backend magic with traits that allows the possibility of any item
      becoming any tool easily. Except welding tools.
  Segrain:
  - bugfix: Lurker slash on knocked down targets no longer causes runtime errors.
  - bugfix: Chestbursting, larva suicide and some other exotic causes of death now
      properly kill you.
  - bugfix: Boiler's Dump Acid ability now correctly attributes its damage.
  Vanagandr:
  - tweak: Increased theoretical maximum clicks-per-second from 6.9 (practical max
      5.5) to 10.26 (practical max 8.5).
  - rscadd: Added a debug tool for determining ingame click rates.
2021-05-25:
  50RemAndCounting:
  - experiment: Added a Surgical Webbing Vest to the synthetic gear vendor and the
      field surgery supplies room in medbay, a new webbing type that can hold only
      surgical tools and nothing else. Can currently hold the entirety of current
      surgical tray's contents, values and stats subject to future change. Sprites
      done by Nauticall!
  - rscadd: Added the M3A1 pattern Synthetic Utility Vest, an M3-VL ballistics vest
      variant which offers no protection and can be used by synthetics.
  - tweak: Changed the Synth Councillor gear preset to spawn with the leather satchel
      instead of the standard USCM satchel to be more in line with the rest of the
      council-exclusive fancy clothing.
  TheDonkified:
  - rscdel: Default BYOND statusbar.
  - rscadd: Custom status bar that is above input now and properly changes between
      darkmode and lightmode.
  - rscadd: Added a preference for hiding the statusbar.
  Vanagandr:
  - bugfix: Using a bayonet to cut the sleeves off of uniforms fixed - no more spamming
      cutting on uniforms that have already had their sleeves removed, plus the safety
      check now functions and means you won't honk your uniform if it doesn't have
      cut sleeve sprites.
  - tweak: Patches/armbands no longer display on-mob if the uniform's sleeves were
      cut off.
  - tweak: Patches/armbands now show on marine snow uniforms with their collar rolled
      or cut off.
  - bugfix: Can now pin medals onto mobs properly. This includes yourself, as well
      as other people. Existing code, but terribly broken. Added some safety checks
      while I was at it.
  - rscadd: Can now perform unga macho bullshit medal award ceremonies by harm-intent
      punching the medal into the recipient's flesh.
  - bugfix: Attaching clothing accessories to jacket items with inventories no longer
      tries to put them into storage, breaking the overlay sprite.
  - rscadd: A variety of jacket-type items can now have accessories attached to them.
      For ex. detective/CMB jackets, pilot flak jacket, hazard vests, labcoats. Marine
      service/dress/officer jackets already had this. Exactly which categories an
      item can take depends on it, IE vests can't have armbands or patches, CMB/detective
      jacket already have badges where a medal would go, CO dress and bomber jackets
      have bling or fur where rank tabs would attach. Rank tabs only attach to marine
      service/dress jackets. No jacket- or suit-type item can attach webbings or shoulder
      holsters. If you attach a flashy hooah moto patch to your ghillie suit and the
      CLF counter-snipers get you, it's your own fault.
  - rscadd: You can also hang medals off of most armours, but remember that bling
      makes for a good bullseye. Also, it will fall off of your armour when the medic
      removes it to zap you back to life.
  - tweak: When spawning in, the game now attempts to attach playtime medals to your
      jacket/armour first, if possible.
  - bugfix: Screaming after being splashed with xeno blood now checks if YOU can feel
      pain, rather than the xeno who did the bleeding.
  - tweak: Misc. typo fixes, minor code adjustments to facilitate the above changes.
  naut:
  - rscadd: Added the Commodore-in-Chief beret for CO senators.
  - tweak: CO vendor modified. Now come with more attachments an' stuff for points.

  - rscadd: Added bump climbing for ledges/platforms; walk into them to start climbing!

  - tweak: End of round fun facts will now pick the best possible statistic when considering
      candidates.

  ChainsawMullet:
  - tweak: Lurker's Invisibility will now always apply a 20% speed boost until the
      invisibility ends, rather than being dependent on no xenos being nearby.
  Nanu:
  - rscadd: Added a resin node landmark spawner, they should only spawn on the appropriate
      game modes.
  - maptweak: Added resin node landmark spawners to all maps in current rotation,
      nightmare inserts included. No more does admins have to mass delete them at
      roundstart during a HvH event.
  - maptweak: Added two new hive spawns to Trijent, one is in the SE Corner of the
      map. Some survs spawns were moved a bit away to compensate for this change.
  - bugfix: Fixed mapping errors on Kutjevo, Solaris Ridge and LV.
  - bugfix: Kutjevo, Solaris Ridge and LV got some slight changes to how their areas
      were placed to make it more consistent.
  TheDonkified:
  - bugfix: Can no longer mix and match ammo handfuls with ammo boxes. For example,
      you can no longer use a handful of normal SMG ammo to fill in an ammo box of
      SMG AP bullets.
  forest2001:
  - tweak: Hunter death message now reports the name of the Hunter instead of 'Unknown'.
      The same applies to the message for thralls.
  - tweak: Honored humans can now carry gear. If this is abused for meta purposes
      it will be retracted.
2021-05-27:
  Carlarc:
  - rscadd: Added some more tips.
  Nanu:
  - tweak: Nerfed the UPP throwing knife slightly as Marines can start with it.

  - rscadd: The masterkey is now specialized in breaching and deals extra damage to
      walls, airlocks, window frames, and other structures. It also does extra damage
      to pylons (4 shots should take out a standard pylon).
  - tweak: The masterkey now loads 5 buckshot shells instead of 3.
  - tweak: Window frames have buffed health (200 -> 600) and can now be shot out.
  - tweak: Airlocks have lower health (2000 -> 1200).
  - tweak: When shot, girders calculate damage from the projectile rather than the
      projectile's ammo type.
  - tweak: When shot, airlocks calculate damage from the projectile rather than the
      projectile's ammo type.
  - tweak: Any bonus projectiles will now inherit the bullet traits from their parent
      projectile.
  - bugfix: The ammo for your gun will no longer be displayed after firing an attached
      gun.
  Vanagandr:
  - rscadd: Added a combat click-drag override preference. When this is set and you're
      on disarm or harm intent, depressing the mouse triggers a click immediately
      even if you hold it down. Clicking something in your inventory, yourself, or
      an ally behaves normally, unless you're a xeno clicking with an empty hand.
      This applies to all clicks, including shooting and middle-mouse abilities.
  - tweak: The game will now only process one click per mouse-down. This shouldn't
      have any practical effect on the game aside from stopping the above from triggering
      extra clicks.
  - rscadd: Added mentorhelp default reply for above pref.
  forest2001:
  - rscadd: Added a new Synthetic species to be used for event tweaks so there aren't
      any conflicts with natural spawns.
  - rscadd: Added an event "hivemind" language (Telepath Implant).
  - rscadd: Added the ability to add/remove status traits via View-Variables.
  - rscadd: Added two traits, Crawler and Simple_Desc. Crawler allows ventcrawling
      with items on. Inanimate prevents examine showing anything other than default
      "desc" variable.
  - bugfix: Monkeys can climb into vents again
  - tweak: High Command radio prefix changed to Z
  - tweak: Intel Radio replaced with Tactics Radio, key changed to T

  50RemAndCounting:
  - tweak: Made the smartgun firing sounds quieter.
  ChainsawMullet:
  - tweak: Standard rifle ammo (used by M41 and L42) has been given 5 armour penetration.
      It is now better or equal to AP up to 20 armour, and can hold its own at 25-30
      while being less effective.
  Jackie_Estegado:
  - tweak: Changed the order limbs are displayed on scanners to be more user friendly.
  TheDonkified:
  - bugfix: The glow filter from fortifying weeds will disappear if a xeno moves off
      weeds when the weeds under them are destroyed.
  - bugfix: The glow filter from fortifying weeds will no longer be shown when xenos
      are on enemy weeds.

      by boilers or blown up.
  - tweak: Sandstone Temple Walls baseturf is now the Temple Floor.
