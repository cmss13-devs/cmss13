      it's an otherwise valid PB (gun can PB, harm intent) an attempt that fails due
      to no ammo, safety, gun on cooldown etc. won't add click delay. You *will* get
      a delay if you miss and click a ground tile, at least until I get around to
      reworking item attack delays (500+ overrides to dig through and adjust means
      don't hold your breath).
  - bugfix: Fixes a bug with suicide where you could turn the safety on or unwield
      a gun that needed to be wielded to fire etc. before it finishes but it still
      killed you.

      as fast. (75 burn intensity, 5 burn duration)
  - tweak: All old explosion procs in dropship_ammo.dm have been converted to use
      cell_explosion, making tweaking much easier. GAU has been left untouched for

      and heavy headshot effects, assigned them to bullets accordingly. Shotgun =
      heavy, small pistols = light, most things = medium.

      hair but below hats/helmets. You know what you have to do.

      unnest each other. '
