  Vanagandr_and_Warfan1815:
  - rscadd: Added a new event ERT - a wealthy big game hunter, here to hunt the ultimate
      game. He's equipped with only the finest turn-of-the-century British hardware,
      including an enormous double-barreled two-bore rifle. The recoil is apocalyptic
      and if you fire it without stopping and bracing using either an action button
      or a specialist activation, you'll have a bad time. If you try to fire it one-handed...
      don't. Improved two-bore object sprite by Sionnach68.

  Jeser:
  - tweak: Simplified vehicle movement code further, removing some parts of it. Vehicles
      still start slower and accelerate to top speed, but driving should feel much
      better.
  - bugfix: Fixed double movement on vehicles.
  - tweak: Wheels and treads now can change 4 vehicle movement characteristics instead
      of just top speed, allowing more flexible adjustment.
  - tweak: APC is faster and more responsive now, has reduced momentum loss for turning.
  - tweak: Regular tank treads were made to be slightly faster, require moving 3 tiles
      to reach top speed. Reinforced treads now have same top speed as regular, but
      take 5 tiles to accelerate to full speed.
  - tweak: Overdrive Enhancer movement buff was reduced from 25% to 20%.
  - rscadd: 'Multitile vehicles now belong to one of four possible vehicle classes:
      weak (currently vans), light (currently APC), medium (currently tank) and heavy,
      which affects ramming results and, in future, more stuff.'
  - tweak: Changed vehicle bumping code to not use huge if else structure. This means
      that absolutely anything can easily be assigned some unique behaviour when being
      rammed by vehicle. Some stuff just gets outright deleted, some explodes, some
      nicely collapses or dismantles instead of being broken and so on. If something
      is not being rammed the way you think it should, you can tell me or add missing
      behaviour yourself.
  - rscadd: Ramming mobs is now logged, this includes FF logs for ramming allies.
      Bad drivers will be much easier to spot.
  - tweak: 'Changes in ramming humans: weak vehicle classes (vans) will apply micro
      knockdown to humans instead of pushing them in front of themselves. Light vehicle
      classes (APC) will do the same for allies and apply longer knockdown and some
      damage to other factions. Heavier classes (tank) will apply longer knockdown
      and damage to humans indiscriminately.'
  - tweak: 'Changes in ramming xenos: heavy class vehicles cannot be blocked at all
      and will drive over most xenos. Weak class vehicles (vans) will push xenos like
      before, while heavier (APC, tank) classes will push them away from themselves,
      making it harder to continuously ram xenos over long distances. APC ramming
      damage multiplier was nerfed from 0.5 to 0.2. Momentum penalty for ramming was
      reduced from 50% to 20%. Defenders now block only weak (vans) class vehicles,
      slowdown light (APC) vehicles by 70% and won''t prevent heavier (tank) classes
      from moving at all, but won''t receive any damage from being rammed.'
  - tweak: Crushers ramming vehicles will produce crash effect inside.
