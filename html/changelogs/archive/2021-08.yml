  Vanagandr:
  - bugfix: 'Humans with no skills are no longer immune to fractures. Examples: adminspawned
      naked people, surgery practice dummy.'
  - bugfix: Rejuvenate()/aheal now fixes larva infection.
  - rscadd: Complete surgery system rework. This was originally TG surgery ported
      and modified for CM by Foolosopher and updated by Optimyst. I then modified
      it heavily to make it behave like the smooth and drape-free Baycode surgeries
      we've grown accustomed to. Adding new surgeries and steps is easy.
  - tweak: 'Specific surgery changes: LARVA SURGERY must be performed on a proper
      surgical table. Use the PICT or else.  Removing the severed larva is fastest
      with a haemostat, middling with bare hands, and improvised tools are slow but
      don''t hurt. Attaching PROSTHETICS is a multiple-step process and the limb must
      be calibrated (hand or haemostat twice) before it will work. The stump of a
      BROKEN PROSTHETIC must be sawn away before a new one can be attached. AMPUTATION
      is a multiple-step process and begins with a scalpel in an opened incision.
      If you begin one by accident and it isn''t too late, you can stitch the muscles
      back together. ORGAN REPAIR loops, treating one organ at a time. REATTACHING
      SYNTH HEADS involves attaching the head, then fully reconnecting it. Make sure
      you''re aiming for the head, not eye or mouth. If the head can talk, the job
      isn''t done.'
  - rscadd: People with surgical skills now have an ability toggle for surgery mode.
      This also temporarily sets help intent safety on or off if you didn't already
      have it, and means you'll attempt to perform surgeries when on on help or disarm
      intent and clicking people with valid items or an empty hand. Also added a keybind
      for switching it on the fly, though it's not set by default.
  - tweak: Medics and POs now have basic surgery skills. Added surgical line to medic
      essentials kit as wound tending is the only useful surgery they can do currently.
  - tweak: Surgical trays no longer have incision management systems. Instead, they
      have the PICT system.
  - rscadd: 'Added new surgical tools: drapes, which do nothing in this revision but
      may come in handy, the PICT system, which is a specialised scalpel used by larva
      surgery, and surgical line, used for sewing flesh together. Surgical line can
      substitute for fixovein, fixovein can substitute for surgical line, and cable
      coil and headbands can be used (in extremis) in place of either. The specialised
      tools are the best in their niche, though. At present, surgical line is only
      in the medic field surgery kit.'
  - rscadd: Added a new surgery for tending wounds, using the new surgical line tool
      or its substitutes. This is a no- or shallow-incision surgery with one looping
      step, healing 10 points of brute and burn damage on the target limb per iteration.
      It can be performed on a patient who's standing up, or yourself.
  - rscadd: Surgeries no longer require a surgery table or rollerbed to perform. Surgeries
      that require the patient to be lying down have a time multiplier depending on
      what surface you're using.
  - rscadd: Some surgeries can be performed on a patient who's standing up. These
      specific surgeries can also be performed on yourself. Standing surgeries don't
      care about the surface they're performed on, and standing vs lying makes no
      difference to their speed.
  - tweak: 'Tweaked skill effects on surgery times: all else the same, a medic/nurse/PO
      will be 20% slower than a doctor, and a synth 40% faster.'
  - rscadd: Aside from pain, the success chance/rng failure system is gone. Improvised
      tools now use time multipliers, causing the step to take longer.
  - rscadd: Once you finish the first step in a surgery, you must finish the surgery
      before you can attempt any others. If you don't complete the first step, the
      surgery is cancelled. Failing the first step doesn't hurt the patient, unless
      it happens because of pain or you did it deliberately.
  - rscadd: You can deliberately fail a step by starting it on disarm intent, if you're
      sure of what you're doing. This will automatically switch you back to help intent
      afterwards.
  - rscadd: Examining yourself or other people now tells you where any incisions or
      surgeries are.
  - rscadd: If surgery conditions aren't ideal, it will message the reasons why. Attempting
      surgery with the wrong tool lists possible steps or surgeries.
  - tweak: Updated the Autodoc to keep it functional, but didn't touch its step times.
      This means that for most operations an autodoc is likely to take much longer
      than an actual doctor. Do your job.
  - rscadd: Ported typecache check from TG. This is much faster than istype(), especially
      for comparing an atom to a black- or whitelist.
  - bugfix: Admin-editing a human's species now properly deletes their old limbs,
      instead of simply making a new limb list.
  - tweak: Removed some duplicate checks from unarmed attack code.
  - imageadd: New sprites for surgical pump, surgical line, and laser scalpels courtesy
      of Triiodine. Tweaked sprites for surgical drills, circular saw, cautery to
      animate them while doing surgery.

      with Unique-Action
  - tweak: Plasma rifle projectiles now renamed to 'Plasma Rifle Bolt' and 'Plasma
      Shatterer'.
  - bugfix: '''Plasma Shatterer'' now explodes on impact with a mob again, detonating
      an explosion roughly half the size of a ''Plasma Eradicator''.'
  - rscdel: Removed plasma rifle inbuilt zoom. (This may be temporary)

      degrees arc of fire and automatic ammo reload that takes 90 seconds to complete.
      They cannot be operated when vehicle's hull integrity is below 50%. FPWs are
      used to provide a covering fire for infantry deploying or entering APC. Any
      marine can use FPWs, however, due to poor visibility through the viewport, person
      manning an FPW has only 6 tiles radius view range. Requires an empty active
      hand. Support gunners have access to Vehicle Status Info, Vehicle Controls Guide
      and Reload Firing Port Weapon verbs in the Vehicle verbs tab.

      on help intent up to 4 revivable corpses into MED APC for triage. As soon as
      human gets defibbed or goes perma, he is added to passengers slots. As soon
      as passenger slots reach 8 (combined amount of passenger and revivable dead
      slots), you cannot utilize this feature until amount of passengers goes below
      8.
  - tweak: MED APC vendors cannot be unwrenched or destroyed and they do not have
