      (a combination of a speed debuff and vision impairment) when used on someone's

      of legacy ss13 sprites.

      a system for applying these effects screen-wide. These can recolour things,
      saturate or desaturate the screen, inflict terrifying colour distortions etc.

      Caramelldansen HUD suffers no such circumscription.

      if your face is identifiable. If your face can't be distinguished you will be
      assumed to be who your ID says you are, rather than an unknown figure playing
      pretend. This does not carry over to radio communication, and you will remain
      identifiable if you speak over radio even while your ID is that of someone else,
      or you are missing one.
  - tweak: Agent ID cards can now set paygrades
  - rscdel: Removed Syndicate Command ID cards as they're legacy code that don't even

  - tweak: Shotgun sentry has 250 health and works like a wired barricade. Xenos attacking
      it or pouncing it while it's turned on will take 20 damage (pounces cause stun
      like wired barricades). It shoots slightly faster and one tile further as well.

      grab instead of 1 for both.
  - bugfix: The plasma flame glob actually has a range of 14 now instead of 11 (sentry
      fired at 14, bullet only went at 11).
  - tweak: Extended flag takes 2 seconds to deploy. It also lost 50 health.
  - tweak: Warbanner takes 0.5 seconds to deploy and pick up and can be walked over.
      The gimmicky warbanner stacking mechanic has been removed and replaced by buffs
      that linger for 5 seconds as you exit the area. It also gained 50 health.
