      a weaker version of WP smoke compared to those employed by MARSOC. They deal
      30 damage per tick, and Aliens and Hunters take 50% reduced damage from this

      the template and represents an older, more worn down version of the gear. Primary
      use will be in temples and such as leftovers.

  stan_albatross:
  - tweak: renamed the \"experimental vendor\" to the \"experimental tools vendor\"
  - rscadd: added the experimental tools token to the synthetic uniform vendor, one
      per synthetic. Inserting this token into the experimental tools vendor gives
      it 45 points, and is how each synthetic will get their points. Each time you
      insert one it will add 45 points to the point tally of the vendor. This avoids
      issues with latejoins and second synths not being able to get synthtools. Survivor
      synths cannot vend these tokens.
  - tweak: 'in lieu of the above changes, the synthetic experimental tools vendor
      now starts with zero points, you must insert an experimental tools token to
      acquire them. '
