  - rscadd: CO's can now choose between vending the M46c, or a Smartgun from their
      vendors. Drums have been added to the vendor as well and can be purchased for
      20 points. The CO's skills have been updated so they can use the new weapon.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where vending barrel attachments (save for the Barrel Charger)
      from the CO's vendor would instead give laser sights...
  Geeves:
  - rscadd: Added a CCT (combat controller) channel for HvH, it's the JTAC counterpart
      for the other team.
  - rscadd: Added a CLF channel, instead of just using the Dutch channel.
  - rscadd: Added faction-specific radio towers, you can no longer piggyback off eachother's
      radio towers. This affects normal gameplay as well, so let me know if bugs crop
      up.
  - rscadd: Added faction-specific crew monitoring consoles, no longer will medbay
      be able to snoop on the groundside enemies. Crew monitoring consoles now look
      at the worn uniform's sensors, rather than arbitrarily hardcoded values. Providing
      a survivor with a marine uniform will now make them show up when they're groundside.
  - rscadd: Added faction-specific tacmap tables, fixed them not refreshing properly,
      too.
  - rscadd: Faction clash now makes defibs ignore armor by default, allowing you to
      take prisoners if you can secure the body, but admins can toggle this flag as
      they wish, during normal gameplay too. This does mean I can add colony comms
      in the future, yes.
  - rscadd: Yautja can now drag dead people even if they're not in their team.
  - tweak: Tweaked the 'Adjust Job Slots' admin command to let them disable roles

  - tweak: During Faction Clash, flashbangs will now be converted into weaker stun
      grenades, and the amount that spawn will be reduced as well.

      piercing dropped down a tier. the damage nerf only takes effect during the Faction
      Clash Gamemode.
  - bugfix: Survivors and xenos will no longer spawn during Faction Clash.
  - tweak: Made weather just spawn its object instead of using vis_contents, this

      scopes during Faction Clash rounds.

      by those who lack the strength for it (only Synths and Predators can use the
      hammer due to their increased strength). To indicate this, messages are now
      displayed when a human tries to pick up or use the hammer.

      menus, where possible.

      in front of them that would stop them from shooting, such as a wall.

  Kaga:
  - rscadd: The XM42B Experimental Anti-Tank Rifle has been reworked into the XM42B
      Experimental Anti-Materiel Rifle. This weapon is not currently available through
      normal gameplay, but may be randomly playtested.
  - rscdel: The XM42B no longer requires a minimum targeting distance of 8 tiles.
  - tweak: The XM42B's ammo and related references have been changed from 'anti-tank'
      to 'anti-materiel' in most cases to reflect the updated identity of the weapon.
  - tweak: Increased the XM42B's damage from 95 to 125. This was previously updated
      as part of the M42C's preliminary update.
  - tweak: Reduced the XM42B's fire delay from a whopping 5.6 seconds down to 3. This
      is still the highest in the family, higher than both the M42A and M42C.
  - tweak: Increased the XM42B's magazine size from 5 rounds to 8.
  - rscadd: The XM42B's ammo now has the Wall-Penetrating trait, as the M42C was previously
      given. It can now hit multiple mobs, objects, and turfs, with each hit reducing
      the maximum range. At point-blank, this comes out to a maximum of eight hits.
  - rscadd: The XM42B's ammo now deals increased damage to walls and pylons, similar
      to the U7 Underbarrel Shotgun. This allows it to break most resin walls and
      doors in one shot, reinforced walls in eight (a full magazine), and Pylons in
      three shots.
  - tweak: Increased the M42C's damage from 125 to 150. This serves to further close
      the gap between its damage per magazine and the M42A's Marksman magazines (750
      vs 1050 to 900 vs 1050), reflect its increased muzzle velocity relative to the
      XM42B despite being the same caliber, and to keep it distinct from the XM42B's
      new identity.
  - rscadd: Adjusted the Ghillie Suit's Aimed Shot ability to now work with all Sniper
      Rifles. By default, this deals 300% damage, but the XM42B and M42C both have
      special damage calculations with it.
  - rscadd: The XM42B's Aimed Shot deals 300% damage against large Xenos (375), and
      180% to everything else (225).
  - rscadd: 'The M42C''s Aimed Shot deals 300% damage against large Xenos (450), 150%
      to smaller Xenos (225), and 200% to everything else (300). As the ability currently
      requires the Sniper Spec''s Ghillie Suit, beware of the recoil. '
  - tweak: Cleaned up some outdated code in the M42A's ammo variants.
  Stan_Albatross:
  - tweak: when deploying a claymore its IFF group will change to that of your inherent
      faction.

2022-03-10:
  Geeves:
  - rscadd: Xenomorphs that are marked for hunt by Yautja will no longer be thanos
      snapped when the dropship takes off. Both these xenos and the snapped xenos
      will now refund their larva to the hive.
  - tweak: A banished xenomorph that changes hives will no longer be banished.
  - rscadd: The embryos inside hugged hosts turn into the Forsaken hive rather than
      insta-killing the host upon hijack.

  - maptweak: Replaces doubled single doors with single double doors on Almayer.

      container has special interaction when clicked by the item (e.g. welding tools
      and fuel backpacks).
  - bugfix: Riot control shotguns now properly accept riot control beanbags (and no
      other shells).
  - bugfix: Personal lockers no longer have unintended interactions with undroppable

  Geeves:
  - tweak: Yautja can now take only one clan shield, it doesn't block damage while

  - rscadd: The Create Humans staff tool can now place spawned mobs at pinpoint accuracy
      if you set the range to spawn to 0.
  - tweak: Exiting out of the Set Custom Event Info input will no longer delete the
      existing info.
  - rscadd: Added some monkeys to the preset loadouts, so I can more easily spawn
      monkeys into the thunderdome. I have sprinkled some additional monkey features
      in for my thunderdome volunteers to discover.
  - bugfix: Fixed some sprite issues with monkeys, their standard marine uniform,
      their standard marine armor, and their standard monkey combat boots.
  Kaga:
  - bugfix: The U7 Underbarrel Shotgun's projectiles now properly function together
      as intended for breaching purposes.

2022-03-16:
  Geeves, Triiodine:
  - rscadd: PMCs, UPP, and CLF now have Squad HUDs that appear over their special
      units, just like the USCM. Factions cannot see eachother's Squad HUDs, only
      their own.
  - tweak: Mutineers now have a mutiny flag set on them, rather than changing faction.
      This will avoid oddities with IFF, and also allow mutineers of other factions
      to exist.
  - tweak: Smartguns now tell you why they can't fire if you don't have the correct
      harness or backpack on.
  - rscadd: Added a CLF CO role, the Cell Commander. They get some goodies.
  - rscadd: PMC Medics, UPP Doctors, and UPP Medics now get surgical line.

  Vanagandr:
  - rscadd: Surgical line is now in doctor and ERT medic starting loadouts, Wey-Med
      Plus, synth, and antag vendors, and surgical kits. Ditto for new Synth-Graft
      mentioned below.
  - tweak: Surgical line/synth graft now fits in medical pouch, first-responder pouch,
      and medic rig belt. Think of it like a hypospray, storagewise - a touch too
      bulky to cram in the clown car lifesaver belt.
  - tweak: Tweaked some ERT loadouts a bit. Mostly moving defibs, health scanners,
      and suture line from backpacks into lifesaver and medic rigs where possible.
  - tweak: Fixovein/surgical line are now less effective when used to substitute for
      each other in surgery, since surgical line is no longer unobtainium. Cable coil
      and headbands were also pushed down a tier.
  - tweak: Standard wound suturing is no longer a surgery and works like kitting,
      done on any intent but Harm and not requiring surgery mode. Patient pain can
      cause it to fail. Suturing surgical incisions closed is still a surgery.
  - tweak: Fixovein/cable coil/headbands no longer work for suturing wounds; they
      can still be used for stitching amputation stumps & closing surgical incisions.
  - tweak: Suture line split into two items - current one to heal brute, new Synthgraft
      to heal burns.
  - tweak: 'Can only suture up to half of a wound''s damage, the rest needs to be
      healed normally. '
  - tweak: 'Suturing time now scales based on damage healed: 5 damage = half the time. '
  - tweak: Kits and sutures partly stack, kit effectiveness varying to a minimum of
      50% healing on a fully-sutured limb. Same final heal amount no matter the order
      of mixed suture and kits.
  - bugfix: 'Can no longer bandage burns or salve IB, preventing kits being wasted
      on the wrong wounds. Ditto for ointment/gauze on already treated/sutured wounds:
      they won''t do anything new, so they aren''t used.'
  - tweak: Tweaked bandage/ointment/kit messaging a bit for a clearer distinction
      between \"you can't bandage because it's already bandaged\" vs \"you can't bandage
      because there's nothing wrong\".
2022-03-21:
  Chiwi:
  - rscadd: RO, POs and DCCs can now roll their sleeves.
  - tweak: CO Service Uniform's shape now matches other service uniforms.

      of whether you're wearing a suit or not.
  - experiment: Converted a bunch of hardcoded lists on items and turfs into generate-on-demand
      lists, which clear themselves after being used. Generally, this should mean
      the server will have more memory for shenanigans. Bugs to look out for include,
      cellular automata from explosions not functioning properly, clothes appearing
      weird on monkeys, and equip and unequip sounds not playing for whatever reason.
  - bugfix: Refactored how flora burns, it should no longer turn into a blazing hellfire.
  - rscadd: Whiskey Outpost is now a gamemode vote rather than a map vote. It now
      shows up once every 25 rounds instead of once every 5 rounds. There is no longer
      a minimum player limit.
  - rscadd: The Force Predator Round admin ability is now Toggle Predator Round. Same
      functionality, but it can disable the Hunt, now.
  - bugfix: Whiteout Terminators can now fire their smartguns again.
  Kugamo:
  - rscadd: 'Adds new feature: Resin Marks. They can be place by xeno Leaders and
      Queen, they denote certain defined meanings and a location to the hive that
      can be either tracked and or overwatched by any hive member. Resin marks expire
      in 30 seconds without weeds, and can be remotely destroyed by either queen or
      their owner. Lastly Queen can force tracking of any mark for a single or for
      all hivemembers.'
  - imageadd: Adds sprites for the Resin Marks.

      toggle internals, and modify suit sensors.
  - bugfix: Gives the proper stripping message to the stripper instead of the strip
      target.

      for admins and everyone around target.

      it affects.
