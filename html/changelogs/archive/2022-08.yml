      make adding new action sprites easier and cause less conflicts
  - rscadd: re-added the first responder pouch - it's like a medical pouch but can
      hold some special items like roller beds and stasis bags, but also can't hold
      some other items. Can be found in the same places as medical pouches.
2022-08-07:
  Jeser:
  - qol: CTRL + Clicking APC Supply vendor starts an automated repeating restocking
      process of every valid items within 1 tile of vendor. Should prevent VC players
      from breaking fingers and hands restocking lots of supplies manually. Information
      about that appears upon examining the vendor.

      there is no need to restock those at roundstart, and even without restocking
      APC can provide marines with basic resupply.

  Stan_Albatross, Frans_Feiffer:

      sized item. Attach it to someone and it will filter out all the drugs from their
      bloodstream over time, but also take some of their blood in the process. Has
      enough charge for 100s of use, or 150u of drugs. Can be recharged. Make sure
      to detach it by clicking the person it's attached to with it again before walking
      away or putting it away, or they'll get a nasty needle wound. Sprites by Frans_Feiffer.
  - rscadd: added a portable dialysis machine to lower medbay, added portable dialysis
      machines to the synthtool vendor for 15 points.

      and M46c (as well as sister guns). Is slightly worse than the solid stock, but
      can be folded. Sprites by Triiodine
  - balance: buffed the rifle solid stock a bit
  - imageadd: resprited the MK1, by Triiodine
  - imageadd: added map variants for the m46c, by Triiodine

  Shad0vvs:
  - bugfix: Fixed possible null runtime in prefrences_savefile.

      ammo boxes can be stacked up to 2 per tile, miscellaneous supply boxes (flares
      and MREs, currently) up to 4 per tile. No stacking for nail gun ammo, because
      of a snowflake sprite.
  - qol: Added flare box overlay to make it easier to separate MRE from flare boxes.
  - balance: Reworked how explosion happens when flaming ammo boxes.
  - code_imp: Explosion level scales with amount of rounds inside. Boxes will not
      explode until amount of rounds inside won't reach a certain threshold. Fully
      filled boxes explode harder now.
  - code_imp: After being flamed, boxes now spend some time being on fire before they
      will be deleted or explode, during which they receive a new on fire overlay.
      This time is also based on amount of ammo in the box. If the box is going to
      blow up, overlay will be slightly different to indicate that.
  - imageadd: New sprites include burning and burning, going to explode overlays as
      well as M94 flare box markings overlay.
  johnravioliUSA:
  - bugfix: The M276 Pattern Ammo Load Rig is now under the belts section of the Surplus
      Uniform Vendor inside the squad prep room.

      (And xeno slashing now doesn't produce the redundant messages)
  Kaga:
  - rscadd: Added in a new type of embedded shrapnel, unexploded ordnance. Currently
      only the event-related AT Rockets can rarely (5%) cause it when hitting unintended
      soft targets (human mobs) directly. Moving with one embedded has a small chance
      to detonate it with each step, but it can be yanked out as with other embedded
      objects.
  - rscadd: Unexploded Anti-Tank Rockets can be manually detonated in various ways
      as a makeshift weapon or tool. While significantly weaker than proper rockets,
      they detonate in a contained direction when used. Despite the potential uses,
      they are highly unstable and prone to accidental detonations with each interaction.
      Exercise caution when handling them!

      marines).

      coordinates).

  Shad0vvs:
  - bugfix: Reverted a change allowing warriors to punch from 2 tiles away and giving
      them daze on punch.
  stanalbatross:
  - bugfix: the British flag will now, once more, display properly in chat
  - bugfix: you can no longer infinitely add glass to airlock assemblies, you can
      now also take glass out of them.
  - bugfix: updated the construction text for airlocks
  - balance: the underbarrel grenade launcher is now pump-action! you must pump it
      TWICE to fire it (open and close the breech, this cocks it). To reload it you
      must open the breech. You open/close the breech (and thus pump it) via UNIQUE-ACTION
      while the attachment is activated
  - qol: you can now unload the UGL as you would with a normal gun, while it is activated
  - soundadd: added new sounds for opening and closing the UGL + reloading grenades
      into the UGL
  - rscdel: blowtorches no longer always protect you from eye damage
  - rscadd: added "old blowtorches", which have a weaker flame that only lets them
      weld vents and doors. However, this makes their welding screens effective and
      as such they do not hurt your eyes.
  - rscadd: added pushups, you can do pushups with a verb in the IC tab
  - bugfix: you can no longer crawl without enough limbs to do so
  - ui: number input now uses tgui
  - bugfix: when making pills from a chemmaster the creation number will now default
      to 16, not 10

  Morrow:
  - rscadd: More options to chief engineer vendor as well as an extended section for

  - rscadd: Adds rock paper scissors, you can play it by help intenting someone's
      head. Your intent influences your play.
  Nanotrasen-Spy:
  - bugfix: Fixed missing icons for ballistic goggles in certain cases
  TotalEpicness, TheDonkified and Lumdor:
  - rscadd: Added charger strain for crusher.
  - experiment: Charger functions very similarly to old crusher. Hold movement key
      and after a while you gain momentum to ram humans and certain objects. Behavior
      upon collision with different things are subject to change.
  - Passive: Directional armor. Charger has 50 frontal armor, 35 side armor, and 25
      rear armor. Because of this ability, charger crusher is unable to direction
      lock itself.
  - experiment: 'Active 1: Toggle Charging. Use this ability to toggle charging on
      and off.'
  - experiment: 'Active 2: Tumble. Clicking to the side of where the crusher is facing
      will launch it 2 tiles to the side in the clicked direction. Hitting a human
      will knock them over. This ability can be used while charge to quickly offset
      yourself. However, it will reset your momentum to 0.'
  - rscadd: Tumble now has cool sound effects and a spin.
  - imageadd: Added tumble ability sprites
  - tweak: Charger now takes 3 full hits to destroy a normal wall instead of destroying
      it in pretty much one. Xeno walls take half damage
  - experiment: 'Active 3: Charger stomp. Unlike the base crusher, it does not stun,
      but does heavy damage to any human unfortunate enough to be under the charger,
      it also applies a mild screen shake to any humans in view and can be used to
      help escape.'
  - experiment: 'Active 4: Ram. A simple offensive ability that flings mobs without
      stun. Much like warrior fling.'
  - rscadd: Xenos blocking a charger's path when charger get pushed to the side, if
      no clear path to move to exists, they get flicker stunned so that charger may
      charge.
  stanalbatross:
  - admin: 'fixed the following broken hrefs : game panel'
