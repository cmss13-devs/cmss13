2022-08-07:
  Jeser:
  - qol: CTRL + Clicking APC Supply vendor starts an automated repeating restocking
      process of every valid items within 1 tile of vendor. Should prevent VC players
      from breaking fingers and hands restocking lots of supplies manually. Information
      about that appears upon examining the vendor.

      there is no need to restock those at roundstart, and even without restocking
      APC can provide marines with basic resupply.

      sized item. Attach it to someone and it will filter out all the drugs from their
      bloodstream over time, but also take some of their blood in the process. Has
      enough charge for 100s of use, or 150u of drugs. Can be recharged. Make sure
      to detach it by clicking the person it's attached to with it again before walking
      away or putting it away, or they'll get a nasty needle wound. Sprites by Frans_Feiffer.

      ammo boxes can be stacked up to 2 per tile, miscellaneous supply boxes (flares
      and MREs, currently) up to 4 per tile. No stacking for nail gun ammo, because
      of a snowflake sprite.
  - qol: Added flare box overlay to make it easier to separate MRE from flare boxes.
  - balance: Reworked how explosion happens when flaming ammo boxes.
  - code_imp: Explosion level scales with amount of rounds inside. Boxes will not
      explode until amount of rounds inside won't reach a certain threshold. Fully
      filled boxes explode harder now.
  - code_imp: After being flamed, boxes now spend some time being on fire before they
      will be deleted or explode, during which they receive a new on fire overlay.
      This time is also based on amount of ammo in the box. If the box is going to
      blow up, overlay will be slightly different to indicate that.
  - imageadd: New sprites include burning and burning, going to explode overlays as
      well as M94 flare box markings overlay.
