  Alardunx:
  - balance: 'Reduced AGM-F cone from 60 degree to 40 degree. Along with the shrapnel
      count reduction from a previous change, this has essentially two effects: The
      situation which caused targets to take all Shrapnels can now at most do ~133%
      expected damage (down from 250%) and the side-hits are even weaker than they
      were before. Directly in front of the target still deals damage similar to what
      it used to be (~8-13 shrapnels)'

      It costs 100 internal health reserves, and can pull any size xeno while they
      are resting, but big xenos cannot be pulled while they are standing. The pulled
