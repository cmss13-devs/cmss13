  Alardunx:
  - balance: 'Reduced AGM-F cone from 60 degree to 40 degree. Along with the shrapnel
      count reduction from a previous change, this has essentially two effects: The
      situation which caused targets to take all Shrapnels can now at most do ~133%
      expected damage (down from 250%) and the side-hits are even weaker than they
      were before. Directly in front of the target still deals damage similar to what

      It costs 100 internal health reserves, and can pull any size xeno while they
