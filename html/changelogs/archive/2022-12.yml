  - imageadd: Re-added animated telegraphs for Abduction. They've been tweaked to

      easily seen.

      and uncoiling of the tail. Captured targets will now have a beam of the Oppressor's

      an overlay of the vice grip on their legs.
  - refactor: Added a proc, .ammo/on_bullet_generation(), for the ammo datum to apply
      effects to the generated bullet/projectile.

  - imageadd: 'Improved locator tube sprites: Now has a pop-out battery slot at the
      top that shows up if emptied. The main green stripe is now a battery indicator
      with appropiately-faded-out yellow warning and blinking red danger sprites.
      The small notch at the bottom is now a bracelet indicator that turns off without
      a battery and blinks red if the bracelet was somehow destroyed.'
  - qol: The locator tube and PDT bracelet now share a serial number, easily viewed
      via examination. This lets you see which PDT/L kits are paired.
  - soundadd: Added a ton of sounds to interactions with the PDT/L kit. Beeps on scanning,
      buzzes on errors, clicks on handling.
