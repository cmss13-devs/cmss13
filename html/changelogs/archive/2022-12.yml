      to, rather than bastardising it by using [Hive.prefix] Hive
2022-12-08:
  Carlarc, Mikola Wei:
  - imageadd: Resprited Oppressor, sprites made by Mikola Wei.
  - imageadd: Re-added animated telegraphs for Abduction. They've been tweaked to
      always have the default border - that way, the weird way byond handles short-lived
      animated objects doesn't make the telegraph absurdly small. It can always be
      easily seen.
  - balance: Oppressor can hook over the M2C and M56D again.
  - refactor: Tail stab's main ability usage is moved to a different proc for future
      custom tail stabs.

      and beams to fire a 3-tile reaching tail hook, that pulls in AND DOES NOT STUN
      marines. (It slows them for 0.5 seconds)
  - imageadd: Oppressor's abduct has had its effect strings changed to imply coiling
      and uncoiling of the tail. Captured targets will now have a beam of the Oppressor's
      tail attached to them (Purely visual) until they reach the Praetorian, alongside
      an overlay of the vice grip on their legs.
  - refactor: Added a proc, .ammo/on_bullet_generation(), for the ammo datum to apply
      effects to the generated bullet/projectile.
  - refactor: Added the bound_beam variable to projectiles. Could be used in the future
      for things like harpoon guns, lasers, etc.
  - bugfix: Fixed non-damaging projectiles causing a blood spurt. (It was checking
      flags && FLAG instead of flag & flag, remember to use CHECK_BITFIELD folks!)

      one spare in every PDT/L kit.
  - qol: PDT/L kits now fold into cardboard.
  - rscadd: Added many spare PDT/L kits and batteries to req. (Marines dropped them
      off at req once they realized they were shitty milsurp knockoffs)
  - balance: Made minibatteries tiny.
  - refactor: Added boldwarning span macro.
  - imageadd: 'Improved locator tube sprites: Now has a pop-out battery slot at the
      top that shows up if emptied. The main green stripe is now a battery indicator
      with appropiately-faded-out yellow warning and blinking red danger sprites.
      The small notch at the bottom is now a bracelet indicator that turns off without
      a battery and blinks red if the bracelet was somehow destroyed.'
  - qol: The locator tube and PDT bracelet now share a serial number, easily viewed
      via examination. This lets you see which PDT/L kits are paired.
  - soundadd: Added a ton of sounds to interactions with the PDT/L kit. Beeps on scanning,
      buzzes on errors, clicks on handling.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug in which a string referenced a null var.
