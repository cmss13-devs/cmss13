  - imageadd: Re-added animated telegraphs for Abduction. They've been tweaked to

      easily seen.

      an overlay of the vice grip on their legs.
  - refactor: Added a proc, .ammo/on_bullet_generation(), for the ammo datum to apply
      effects to the generated bullet/projectile.
  - refactor: Added the bound_beam variable to projectiles. Could be used in the future

      top that shows up if emptied. The main green stripe is now a battery indicator
      with appropiately-faded-out yellow warning and blinking red danger sprites.
      The small notch at the bottom is now a bracelet indicator that turns off without
      a battery and blinks red if the bracelet was somehow destroyed.'
  - qol: The locator tube and PDT bracelet now share a serial number, easily viewed
      via examination. This lets you see which PDT/L kits are paired.
  - soundadd: Added a ton of sounds to interactions with the PDT/L kit. Beeps on scanning,
      buzzes on errors, clicks on handling.

      (Runners/Praetorians/Drones/Defenders/Warriors/Sentinels/Spitters) and accessed.
      Use a pack in help intent on a xeno to strap it to her after a duration. Access
      it with an empty hand in help intent after a duration. Drag a xeno with a pack
      to you when you have an empty hand to unstrap it from her after a duration.
  - rscadd: Added the Shake verb to storage items. Humans and xenos can now shake
      emptyable inventories which has a 75% chance to drop an item if there are any.
      Xenos also have a 25% chance to cause the pack fall off them when empty.
  - balance: Resin fruit is now class size medium but size cost large so five can
      fit in a backpack.

  - code_imp: Refactored /atom/movable/vis_obj/xeno_wounds so it can be more generic
      as just vis_obj (now it will be used by both wounds and packs and packs don't
      need to be xeno_wounds) and use VIS_INHERIT_DIR instead of a signal.
  - bugfix: Xeno wounds no longer inherit hive color.

      with windows'

      add:The S&W ''model 48'' revolver is very powerful, but also inaccurate. You
      will be able to focus on your shots better if you do some cool tricks with it
      first?

      add:Nagant: Shrapnel shot has unique handful sprites.

      add:BR blasters have USCM pistol placeholder inhands.'
  - bugfix: Fixes blood and footprints blocking weed clearing.
  - bugfix: Hitting a turf with any item will first check if the item has weeds on

  - qol: Requisition vendors now vend to floor when they are not vending to the front

      firing strong, inaccurate AP bullets.

      accessible in New Varadero for now.
  - imageadd: Added attachment sprites for every bayonet type.
  - balance: The CMB revolver has received a complete overhaul. It has completely
      refreshed alien isolation sounds, has gotten a complete stat pass, and now fires

      boxes.
  - rscadd: Almost all of the PMC corpse spawns' NSG 23s and magazines were replaced
