      if they highlight the whole message or not.

      you can more efficiently utilise it to its full pill making potential.

  Zonespace27:
  - admin: Added SDQL2 tools, allowing for more granular mass VV/proc calling/data
      collecting.
  - refactor: Refactored VV backend
  carlarctg:
  - rscadd: Aiming a shot on a sniper rifle now adds a red laser beam that connects
      the target and the aimer. Spotting designators will emanate a faint yellow one.
      Both will slowly increase in alpha from 0 to max as the tracking progresses.
  - balance: The sniper's laser beam can be disabled with a button, but keeping it
      enabled reduces aiming shot time. Cloaked spotters will not cause a beam to
      appear.
  - imageadd: Completely resprited the indicators for spotting (it's now yellow) and
      aiming (it's now red, usually)
  - imageadd: The XM42B and PMC sniper rifles have more intense blue lasers and reticles.
  - rscadd: Stepping through laser beams will check for eye protection, if it isn't
      sufficient, and the small probability chance passes, the target will scream
      in pain! Completely flavor. If they have enough eye protection, it will bounce
      off their headgear, and if said protection is BiMex patented personal shades
      it will create a cool visual effect.
  - refactor: Refactored eye_protection to have three levels, flavor, flashes, and
      welding. Sunglasses have flavor protection, sechuds have flash protection, welding
      gear has welding protection.
  - imageadd: The spotter's designator now has a white band on it to distinguish it
      from the rest.
  - rscadd: Chance's claim EMPTY explosive magazines are now EMPTY HEAP magazines.
  harryob:
  - admin: fixed logging when you leave buildmode
  stanalbatross:
  - bugfix: vehicle entry speeds will no longer be extraneously multiplied

      this, attacking a stack in your offhand with one of the same type will no longer
      ask you how many you want to merge into it.
2023-01-05:
  Segrain:
  - bugfix: Splitting stacks actually works now.
  - bugfix: Aliens and telekinetics no longer can abuse splitting stacks.

  - rscadd: Dancer Impale now plays a stronger hit sound and hit animation.

  - rscadd: Abominations spin around when devastating a target.
  - code_imp: changed facedir() into face_dir()
  - balance: Changed the Smith & Wesson's caliber from .357 to .38 to remove compatibility
      between its rounds and the Spearhead revolver's.
  - balance: Reduced the amount of time the Smith & Wesson's trick buff lasts.
