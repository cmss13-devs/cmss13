      enabled reduces aiming shot time. Cloaked spotters will not cause a beam to

      sufficient, and the small probability chance passes, the target will scream
      in pain! Completely flavor. If they have enough eye protection, it will bounce
      off their headgear, and if said protection is BiMex patented personal shades
      it will create a cool visual effect.
  - refactor: Refactored eye_protection to have three levels, flavor, flashes, and
      welding. Sunglasses have flavor protection, sechuds have flash protection, welding
      gear has welding protection.
  - imageadd: The spotter's designator now has a white band on it to distinguish it
      from the rest.

  NewyearnewmeUwu:
  - spellcheck: fixed a vamp lurk typo involving Rush
  carlarctg:
  - balance: The MP27 is a now robust and ergonomic option with no wield slowdown
      now, though it does have a lot of scatter due to its dense bullets and cheap
      construction. However, due to a factory mixup almost all of its magazines have
      been randomly manufactured as 20, 30, or 40-rounders.
  - rscadd: The MP5 is, effectively, a slightly slower firing but more damage dealing
      M39, with small-sized magazines.
  - rscadd: The FN FP9K is now a VERY robust, quick-shooting, long-ranged SMG that
      mantains its AP bullets and small-sized 50 rounder mags. Keep an eye out for
      these.
  - rscadd: The MAC-15 and Uzi are now bursting inaccurate beasts, the latter a slightly
      slower firing, slighty more damaging version. Both have recieved extended magazine
      sprites and overlays, the latter's also having a small jam chance..
  - imageadd: The PPSH has special codersprite stick magazines and inhands now! Fitting
      a drum magazine there will cause the gun to have worse handling, with more slowdown,
      worse aim delay.... and jamming! Both the PPSH and uzi can now jam, needing
      you to mash the unique action hotkey. Comes with unique SFX. The PPSH's base
      stats have been significantly improved as well, making it a longer-ranged, less
      falloff, but less damage alternative to the M39.
