      aiming (it's now red, usually)

      sufficient, and the small probability chance passes, the target will scream
      in pain! Completely flavor. If they have enough eye protection, it will bounce
      off their headgear, and if said protection is BiMex patented personal shades
      it will create a cool visual effect.
  - refactor: Refactored eye_protection to have three levels, flavor, flashes, and
      welding. Sunglasses have flavor protection, sechuds have flash protection, welding
      gear has welding protection.
  - imageadd: The spotter's designator now has a white band on it to distinguish it
      from the rest.

      "*SALUTE" are equally valid ways to salute).'
