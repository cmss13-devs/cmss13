  - code_imp: END of contribs from Ben10083
  - code_imp: Changes /datum/rank to /datum/yautja_rank to be clearer on what it is
      used for.
  - rscadd: Added access defines for Yautja ship.
  - rscadd: Added rank identifiers on Yautja equipment presets to help set access
      levels on their bracer chips.
  - maptweak: Changed the doors on the Yautja ship to be their own subtypes, with
      certain ones being locked to Yautja or certain Yautja Ranks.
  - code_imp: Slightly modernised obj/proc/allowed, and also made it check for access
      on bracer chips if present.
  - maptweak: Replaced the unworthy prey section of the Yautja Ship with a secondary
      armory for plasma rifles, however the door is inaccessible to most Yautja. Intended
      to make it a bit less obvious admins are spawning them in for the rare times
      they're used/necessary.
  - maptweak: Above armory will automatically open if an Abomination is detected.
  - maptweak: Reduces amount of herbs on the Yautja Ship.
  - maptweak: Fixes the "Consoles" orientation in the Yautja flight deck.

  - rscadd: Made Yautja cloak cost no power to operate, and created multipliers for
      disabled duration based upon what caused the Yautja to decloak.
  - rscadd: Added a toggle for Yautja bracer lock. This also works with the same mechanic
      of SDing another Yautja.
  - rscadd: Added a message to all Yautja if an SD is cancelled.
  - ui: Adds a UI panel for Yautja emotes, all credit to Zonespace.
