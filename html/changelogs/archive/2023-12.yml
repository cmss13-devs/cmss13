  alexguinea atticus-rezzer:
  - rscadd: Adds alarm sound for lifeboats when launching
  fira:
  - bugfix: Cryoing someone now properly takes into account role weights for the purpose
      of latejoin larvas. This should very slightly increase larvas amount.
  - bugfix: Roundstart distributed amount of gear and ASRS points now takes shipside
      role weights into account. This should moderately decrease budget and starting
      gear.
  - bugfix: Roundstart distributed amount of gear and ASRS points does not count Survivors
      and Monkeys anymore. This should moderatly decrease budget and starting gear.
  - rscadd: Main marine vendors and ASRS now get matching supply for every additional
      marine latejoining, similar to larvas. This should be a substantial increase
      over the course of a round. Supplies given are 60% of what a roundstart marine
      would give.
  - balance: Amount of gear in main marine vendors and ASRS supplies have been decreased
      by 40% to help counteract added supplies the marines will get in latejoining.
      Hopefully this also keeps reqs active to dispatch new supplies.
  - bugfix: Altered a few items vendor stock scalings to be linear for use with the
      new system, such as RTO pack, Drop Pouch and Machete Pouch.
  - rscadd: Introduced ASRS supply pools. As proof of concept, ASRS now spawns a crate
      of food ingredients every 30 minutes, in addition to regular gear.
  - balance: ASRS now keeps track of partial crates awarded. This means if you should
      receive 2.5 then 2.5 crates, you now get 2 then 3, rather than 2 and 2. This
      is intended to result in smoother, more reliable transitions and scaling with
      varying amount of Xenos on map.
  - balance: Amount of ASRS crates awarded was reduced by about 15.5% to make up for
      crates carrying over. Overall this should result in an about 5-10% reduction
      in highpop crates, and ~10% increase in lowpop. Pop being based on xeno count.
  - code_imp: Refactored part of ASRS supply code to be less of a painful, antique
      artifact.
  - bugfix: Fixed incorrect weighting in the ASRS supply code, effects on crate distributions
      are unknown.
  - bugfix: Fixed HPR ammo ASRS packs failing to spawn and ending up as MK1s instead.
