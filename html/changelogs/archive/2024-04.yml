  Kaga:
  - rscadd: Added the XM43E1 Anti-Materiel Rifle as a pickable sidegrade option for
      USCM Sniper Specs through the vendor, mutually exclusive with the normal M42A
      Sniper Rifle. The AMR can shred obstacles, blow a hole through most infantry
      and their equipment, and even hit a collateral on multiple targets or through
      light cover, but its lack of specialized ammunition and small magazine mean
      that you'll need to make every shot count. Ammo can be bought from Req, at the
      same cost per magazine as the M42A.
  - balance: Completely updated the XM43E1 AMR, adding damage falloff to its wall-piercing
      properties whenever it hits something alongside range loss. Most things reduce
      its damage by 20%. Dense walls and big xenos reduce both the damage and range
      3 times as much.
  NervanCatos:
  - balance: removes CT access to marine prep weapons racks, doubles ammo count of
      all regular ammo in req to compensate.
  SabreML:
  - admin: Added attack logging for Xeno tackling.
  Vanagandr, totalepicness:
  - rscadd: Added a button to event panel to give xenomorphs opposable thumbs and
      firearms permits, to individuals, to hives, or to all xenos everywhere. They're
      clumsy, though, and have issues with fine manipulation sometimes. Remember that
      warriors cannot throw objects and make for poor grenadiers.
  - rscadd: Xenos with opposable thumbs can use buckles, drive vehicles, use machine
      guns and vendors without care for access or skills
  Waseemq1235:
  - mapadd: Added an APOLLO maintenance controller to the Warden's Office.
