      are LITTLE_BRUISED (Have a damage equal or above 1), BRUISED (Have a damage
      equal or above 10), BROKEN (have a damage equal or above 30) or "HEALTHY" (any
      damage below 1). And the penlight, that can be used the same way to check the
      condition of brain and eyes by aiming the eyes of the person you are interacting
      with. Also with the fixing mentioned above, you can now flash people''s eyes
      again! Everytime you check the condition of someone''s eyes, you will also flash
      them. Replaced one letter vars in the flashlight code and on the stethoscope
      section of the ties code.'
