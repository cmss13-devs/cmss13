  - bugfix: Certain fill icon states have been modified to look proportionally filled
      compared to the next step up.
  - bugfix: Bottle lids aren't so high up on the bottle sprite.
  - refactor: Beakers (currently only silver) that act as a catalyst for reagents
      during chemical reactions have their own path instead.
  - imagedel: Removed unnecessary icon states.
