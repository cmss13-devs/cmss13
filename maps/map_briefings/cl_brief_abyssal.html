<br /><u>Special Services Division</u><br />Liaison Colony Briefing<br />
<hr />
<br />The automated AI aboard your stationed ship has informed us that a distress
signal has been picked up from a space station within your sector, and that a
mission is being prepared to investigate the disturbance.<br /><br />As such, the special
services division has prepared a briefing on the nature of the colony, and known
potential threats to it's operation.<br /><br />Classified materials have been
excluded from this briefing and should be requested separately, and as such, the
contents of this document may be shared or withheld at your discretion unless
otherwise specified.<br />

<hr />
<br /><b>History and Purpose</b><br />
<hr />
<br />Con-Am 81 "Abyssal" station is based on a low-cost, mass produced design
of a station with modularity in mind. It is one of the few profitable products
manufactured by the Con-Am corporation.<br /><br />Abyssal station was constructed
in 2122 and has been in continual operations for sixty years. It is strategically
placed within close distance of several major private and government operated mining colonies.
Many of which are or were operated by or leased to Con-Am, Abyssal serves as the major
interstellar link between these colonies and the core worlds.<br /><br />The Con-Am corporation can be described as a middle-rung
corporation. It was once a major corporate player within the Solar System, specializing
in mining operations on the many moons of Jupiter, primarily Io, and was once considered
a potential rival to Weyland-Yutani.<br />The corporation suffered a major loss of prestige
and soft power in the 2130s after a United American federal investigation, initially
spearheaded by a single federal marshal, uncovered evidence the corporation was secretly
administering polydichloric euthimal to its mining workers, an illegal and highly dangerous
amphetamine that typically causes its consumer to become psychotic after continual use.
The outcome of this investigation implicated several highly placed Con-Am executives,
resulting in mass arrests.<br /><br />By the 2180s, many of Con-Ams remaining mining operations
have become increasingly exhausted, placing massive financial strain on the corporation.
The deluge of lawsuits that ensued from the outcome of the federal investigation resulted
in there being insufficient capital to allow the corporation to expand its mining operations to new sectors,
resulting in most of the companys cashflow coming from its pre-existing and rapidly depleting
mining operations. There are doubts the company will survive the next decade.<br /><br />Abyssal station
has suffered from a significant lack of maintenance and refurbishment due to these financial
stressors. Its station personnel also suffer significant personnel turnover, due to non-competitive
payrates and the decreasing economic value of the system it is in due to the ongoing mining
operation closures.<br />
<br /><b>Company Priorities</b><br />
<hr />
<br />Intercepted communications from the station revealed the alleged
recovery of an unknown object of potential extra-terrestrial origin, classified herein as a xeno-craft,
and that the crew were preparing to conduct on-site examination of the xeno-craft.<br /><br />The possible recovery
of a xeno-craft has attracted the attention of our Research and Development division, however, due
to the distances involved the risk of Con-Am Security Services or an unknown third-party conducting
site rescue and salvage operations prior to the arrival of a Weyland-Yutani recovery team are considered high.
<br /><br />Information regarding the presence of this xeno-craft should only be divulged on a need to know basis,
however the xeno-craft and whatever contents onboard it are considered the only items of value onboard
the station at this time<br /><br />Abyssal station contains only a token force of several Colonial Marshals.
There are no on-site Con-Am security service personnel
and only a skeleton crew of shipside personnel. Only the stations Captain and Con-Am corporate liaison can
be considered to have a vested interest in the continual operations of the station or its claim over
the xeno-craft. The rest of the station personnel are likely to be easily swayed to our cause via financial
or job-transfer incentives.<br /><br />You are tasked to ascertain the station-side situation and attempt to
secure control over the xeno-craft for recovery by a Weyland-Yutani recovery force. You are pre-authorized to
offer job-transfers to station personnel and offer cash incentives in the service of securing control of the xeno-craft.<br />
<br /><b>Potential Threats</b><br />
<hr />
<br />An assessment of the situation by our analysts suggests the most likely causes of the distress beacon,
from most to least likely:<br /><br />* Failure to maintain the stations long-range communications equipment.
<br />*  Unintended interference of the stations power net or communications system due to recovery of unknown xeno-craft.
<br />* Station personnel are confined to the stations radiation bunker due to on-going radiological
breach, precluding their ability to dispatch communications.<br />
