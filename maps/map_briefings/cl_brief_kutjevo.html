<br /><u>Special Services Division</u><br />Liaison Colony Briefing<br />
<hr />
<br />The ship AI aboard your stationed ship has informed us that a distress
signal has been picked up from the colony on LV-686, and that a mission is being
prepared to investigate the disturbance.<br /><br />As such, the special
services division has prepared a briefing on the nature of the colony, and known
potential threats to it's operation.<br /><br />Classified materials are
excluded from this briefing and should be requested separately, and as such, the
contents of this document may be shared or withheld at your discretion, unless
otherwise specified.<br />

<br /><b>History and Purpose</b><br />
<hr />
<br />Discovered in 2089, the planet Dykuma I, also known as LV-686, was
originally marked by geological survey as a potentially terraformable desert
planet, was later found to be abundantly rich in underground aquifers of
exceptionally high purity, and as such an independent core colony began
colonization efforts in the 2160s.<br /><br />Shortly after the colonization
efforts began, a hostile takeover by the Canadian Space Affairs Ministry in 2162
brought the colony under new ownership, soon sold to the Weyland-Yutani
Corporation, where in 2165 it began operations as a bottling plant under the
<i>Weyland Spring</i> brand.<br /><br />As the demand for spring water and the
size of the colony's operations both have grown, the deposits of drinking water
at the original site for the colony have dried up, and as such the sprawl has
continued to expand outwards, ever in search of more desposits to tap.<br /><br />With
an estimated 2500 colonists, the refinery has become a bustling town, and the
number one provider of drinkable water in the Neroid Sector and surrounding
space, as well as a significant supplier for the
<i>Weyland Spring</i> brand.<br /><br /><b>Company Priorities</b><br />
<hr />
<br />The number one priority is that any operation on the site of Weyland
Spring Bottling Center No.8 does not employ chemical weapons or otherwise risk
contaminating the ground water supply and the aquifers below. The use of lead
and depleted uranium bullets should be avoided.<br /><br />In addition to this,
the colony's water treatment plant contains large stockpiles of chemicals that
may be hazardous in unapproved amounts, and damage to the tanks storing these
chemicals must be mitigated.<br /><br /><b>Potential Threats</b><br />
<hr />
<br />The Kutjevo facility contains only a token Colonial Marshals Bureau,
staffing roughly 2-6 members, and is primarily staffed by corporate security.
While the security garrison is relatively undersized for a colony of this size,
division analysts believe corporate espionage is unlikely due to a variety of
factors. After reviewing the data, the analysts believe these are the most
likely causes for the automated distress beacon, from most to least likely:<br /><br />*
Geological Activity; e.g. earthquakes or land-shift due to the drained aquifers
beneath the site.<br />* Maintenance failure of the colony's communications
equipment.<br />* Failure to send the weekly "All-Clear" signal to prevent
automated distress being dispatched.<br />* Sabotage by the "Colonial
Liberation Front"<br />* A solar flare from the Dykuma star causing electrical
failures.<br />
