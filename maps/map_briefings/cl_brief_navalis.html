<br /><u>Special Services Division</u><br />Liaison Colony Briefing<br />
<hr />
<br />The ship AI aboard your stationed ship has informed us that a distress
signal has been picked up from an off-shore platform on planet Aires, and that a mission is being
prepared to investigate the disturbance.<br /><br />As such, the special
services division has prepared a briefing on the nature of the colony, and known
potential threats to it's operation.<br /><br />Classified materials are
excluded from this briefing and should be requested separately, and as such, the
contents of this document may be shared or withheld at your discretion, unless
otherwise specified.<br />

<br /><b>History and Purpose</b><br />
<hr />
<br />Navalis Platform 13 is one in a series of offshore platforms known
as the 'Navalis Cluster'. This cluster consists of fourty seven offshore
platforms, the majority of which are semi-automated, meaning they require only
a minimal crew compliment.<br /><br />The seabed of this world is rich in
hydrocarbons and other valuable minerals. The abundance of this is such that
the continued operation of the Navalis Cluster is of paramount importance not only
to the corporation, but to the United American and Imperial governments.<br /><br />
<hr />
<br />NP-13 is the command and control platform of the cluster. It has crew
quarters to hold up to two hundred personnel and three landing pads with associated
shuttles to allow rapid transit between all platforms in the cluster. As the majority
of the platforms in the cluster are semi-automated, only a minimal crew requirement is
needed on these platforms at any given time. Otherwise, crews are rotated through NP-13.
<br /><br />Under normal circumstances, it can be expected that the true crew compliment
of NP-13 is around 30 to 50 personnel.<br /><br />The platform holds only a modest security
compliment of a dozen personnel, however they are issued with modern weaponry and defensive
system compliments.
<hr />
<br />Amongst corporate personnel, a posting on this world is considered a dead-end career path
for senior ranked individuals, whereas for junior ranked personnel this posting is seen as an
excellent starting point in your career.<br /><br />Take this into consideration when interacting
with local personnel. You are authorised to offer off-world transfers or single-rank promotions to
platform personnel should this be in the general interests of the company.
<br />It is the opinion of our Security analysts division that the most likely cause of this
distress signal is a cyclone that has struck the platform and has disabled it. The platform is
rated to survive up to Category 7 hurricane's and similar events, nonetheless damage to exterior
communications is possible.<br /><br />However our security division can not rule out the risk
of an armed outside group assaulting the station. As such, the dispatchment of a military relief
mission to investigate this issue has been put forward as the best course of action.
<hr />
<br /><b>Recent Information</b><br />
<hr />
<br />The final report transmitted from the platform prior to ceasation of communications, indicated
that the platform personnel had started to detect sub-surface movement on the ocean floor. This is
considered unexpected, as there is minimal xeno-fauna life that can survive at those depths. The local
scientific personnel believe these movements may be the result of the on-going mining operation.
<hr />
<br /><b>Final Note</b><br />
<hr />
<br />Liaison. The strategic value of this platform is absolute. The loss of any other platform
would only be a minor setback. However, this platform is solely responsible for the operation
of the entire Navalis cluster. If this platform is disabled for a long duration, or worse destroyed,
then the financial consequences will send major shockwaves through the local sector division, and risk
a substantial, single digit, drop in quarterly profits.
