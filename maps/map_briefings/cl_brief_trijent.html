<br /><u>Special Services Division</u><br />Liaison Colony Briefing<br />
<hr />
<br />The ship AI aboard your stationed ship has informed us that a distress
signal has been picked up from the colony on Raijin, and that a mission is being
prepared to investigate the disturbance.<br /><br />As such, the special
services division has prepared a briefing on the nature of the colony, and known
potential threats to it's operation.<br /><br />Classified materials are
excluded from this briefing and should be requested separately, and as such, the
contents of this document may be shared or withheld at your discretion, unless
otherwise specified.<br />

<br /><u><b>Planet</b></u

>: Oxley's Butte<br /><u><b>Operator</b></u
>: Trijent Corporation (Company Subsidiary)<br /><br />
<hr />
<br /><b>History and Purpose</b><br />
<hr />
<br />The colony of Oxley's Butte, often colloquially referred to as "Trijent
Dam" was settled after the discovery of vast reserves of Lithium-6 below the
surface of what was at the time known as LV-670. In 2129, Geological survey
teams landed on the planet and began to discern the ideal location to place a
mining settlement, eventually settling on a river fork on the planet's northern
hemisphere, roughly 4 kilometers above one of the particularly rich deposits.<br /><br />To
power the mining operations, the Cebrini group was contracted to construct and
operate a large hydroelectric dam, utilizing the river's high throughput, with
three turbines working to produce an estimated 15,000Mw/H of electricity. Work
began in 2132, as the first colonists were brought in, with the hydroelectric
facility and electrical infrastructure being completed in late 2150,
colonization began as workers of other specialities were shipped in to fill the
needs of the rapidly growing colony. At present, the colony hosts a mix of
corporate personnel from both Trijent Corp. and the Cebrini Group, as well as a
number of third-party personnel staffing various positions.<br /><br />The
colony on Raijin has provided lithium to buyers across the galaxy for about 20
years now, in addition to hosting an archeological worksite due to
<b>mundane</b> discoveries in the periphery of the mining campsites.<br /><br /><b
	>Company Priorities</b
><br />
<hr />
<br />Lithium-6 is one of the principle components of Tritium, needed to fuel
the fusion reactors powering a galaxy worth of human expansion. As such,
Raijin's immeasurably rich deposits of the mineral have led the Trijent
Corporation, and by extension, the Company, to a domineering position in the
market for fusion reactor fuel. Due to the nature of the ore reserves, damage to
the mining site itself is of limited concern, however, the hydroelectric dam
powering the colony is a highly valuable asset and it is paramount that it is
returned to operation as soon as possible if damaged, and that further damage
from intervention is minimized.<br /><br />Of secondary priority, the
northeastern edge of the colony hosts an archeological site and attached
research lab. The research notes from the lab should be recovered and delivered
to the Company as soon as possible, and care should be taken not to disturb or
destroy the dig sites, and the artifacts buried within.<br /><br /><b
	>Potential Threats</b
><br />
<hr />
<br />Due to the economic relavence of the colony, both Neroid Sector Policing
Authority and Corporate security staffing are present in various capacities. As
such, the majority of known threats to the colony's operation have been dealt
with swiftly and without incident. Despite this, company analysts believe the
most likely cause for the distress signal are as follows; From most to least
likely.<br />* Carelessness in sending the weekly required "All Clear" signal,
preventing the automated distress beacon.<br />* Failure in maintenance of the
colony's communication equipment.<br />* Sabotage of equipment by the "Colonial
Liberation Front".<br />* Viral or Bacterial outbreak.<br />* Disruption by the
Union Of Progressive Peoples as they establish a competing colony elsewhere on
the planet.<br />* Corporate Espionage to disrupt the Trijent Corporation as a
leader in fusion reactor fuel.<br />
