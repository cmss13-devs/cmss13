[b]USCM REF[/b]: 48-77-SE
[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Engagement Protocol – Solaris Ridge AO

Commander,  

Solaris Ridge has gone dark under suspicious conditions. Colonial records cite environmental failure, sabotage, and contamination. All signs point to Xenomorph infestation and weak security oversight. You are ordered to seize control of the area and reestablish dominance with decisive force.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Deploy a fortified base in the colony's administrative and secure any and all personnel files.  
[*]Sweep colonial infrastructure and disused mineral transport network for hostile hive presence.  
[*]Capture or destroy all unauthorized Weyland-Yutani materials and personnel as per Directive 61-E.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Enforce martial order across the Ridge and detain suspicious survivors in the field.
[*]Scuttle remaining research modules to prevent foreign exploitation.  
[*]Reinforce the colony's perimeter and eliminate all unregistered lifeforms.[/list] You are authorized to demolish critical infrastructure if it aids in strategic containment. Let this serve as a warning to all: the Corps does not tolerate failure.

No mercy. No doubt,
Colonel Margaret A.W. Shanks
