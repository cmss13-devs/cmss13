<b><u>TO</u></b>: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer<br>
<b><u>SUBJECT</u></b>: Deployment Priorities &#45 Solaris Ridge AO<br>
<small><u>USCM REF</u>: 48-77-HM CONFIDENTIAL</small>
<hr>
Commander,<br>
<br>
Solaris Ridge is more than a derelict outpost, it's home to forgotten workers, families, and scientific pioneers.<br>
<br>
Satellite interference suggests they've gone silent amid worsening environmental strain.<br>
<br>
Your task is to protect what remains and who remains.
<hr>
<b>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Establish a relatively unobtrusive Forward Operating Base to avoid unnecessary disruption.
	<li>- Locate and assist any remaining research personnel, particularly those affiliated with atmospheric control and botany.
	<li>- Secure research findings relevant to the Ridge's lichen-based terraforming experiments.
</ul>
<br>
<b>SECONDARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Maintain structural integrity of airlocks and shelter points to facilitate civilian use.
	<li>- Avoid unnecessary force during crowd encounters or tunnel sweeps. Exercise judgment before lethal engagement.
	<li>- Use auxiliary medevac protocols for trauma cases discovered during recon missions.
</ul>
<br>
Hearts and minds may not win every war, but they win the right ones.<br>
<u>Let your conduct reflect the humanity we fight to preserve.</u>
