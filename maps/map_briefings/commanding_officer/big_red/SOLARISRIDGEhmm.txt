[small]CONFIDENTIAL – USCM INTERNAL MEMORANDUM  
[b]USCM REF[/b]: 48-77-HM  
[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Deployment Priorities - Solaris Ridge AO

Commander,  

Solaris Ridge is more than a derelict outpost—it’s home to forgotten workers, families, and scientific pioneers. Satellite interference suggests they’ve gone silent amid worsening environmental strain. Your task is to protect what remains and who remains.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Establish a relatively unobtrusive Forward Operating Base to avoid unnecessary disruption.  
[*]Locate and assist any remaining research personnel, particularly those affiliated with atmospheric control and botany.  
[*]Secure research findings relevant to the Ridge’s lichen-based terraforming experiments.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Maintain structural integrity of airlocks and shelter points to facilitate civilian use.  
[*]Avoid unnecessary force during crowd encounters or tunnel sweeps—exercise judgment before lethal engagement.  
[*]Use auxiliary medevac protocols for trauma cases discovered during recon missions.[/list] Hearts and minds may not win every war, but they win the right ones. Let your conduct reflect the humanity we fight to preserve.

In service to justice and peace,  
Colonel Adrian Blackburn
