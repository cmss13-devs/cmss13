[small]CONFIDENTIAL – USCM INTERNAL MEMORANDUM  
[b]USCM REF[/b]: 48-77-RI
[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Research-Oriented Objectives – Solaris Ridge AO

Commander,  

This mission classifies under Experimental Asset Salvage. Solaris Ridge was used by Weyland-Yutani for long-term bioengineering trials involving fungal and atmospheric cross-regulation. Seismic patterns and lost data uplinks suggest anomalous Xeno contact. Your priority is not elimination, it is extraction.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Deploy scientific forward modules to the Ridge’s central research facilities and surrounding infrastructure.
[*]Recover climate-stabilization data, lichen growth logs, and any evidence of synthetic-AI interaction.  
[*]Secure live or inert Xenomorph specimens if containment can be achieved safely.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Avoid unnecessary damage to data cores, relay pylons, and sample cryofridges.  
[*]Document all hive adaptations to low-atmosphere environments—record visual evidence.  
[*]If applicable, repurpose solar relay stations to power research equipment.[/list] Remember: an intact discovery is worth more than a burned one. Bring the science back with you intact, if possible.

Onward through progress,
Lt. Colonel Geoffrey Lamdem
Division Logistics Commander
Military Organization for Development and Innovation – 4th Combat Division
