<b><u>TO</u></b>: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer<br>
<b><u>SUBJECT</u></b>: Deployment Priorities &#45 LV-522 "Chance's Claim" AO<br>
<small><u>USCM REF</u>: 48-77-HM CONFIDENTIAL</small>
<hr>
Commander,<br>
<br>
Chance's Claim is a company-run power colony with a small civilian population and dual-reactor core.<br>
<br>
The distress signal was followed by the deployment, and silence, of our Force Recon unit.<br>
<br>
We must act quickly, but responsibly. Lives are likely still at risk; both ours and theirs.
<hr>
<b>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Establish a Forward Operating Base, ideally using existing infrastructure, without structural damage.
	<li>- Locate civilian survivors and FORECON personnel, avoid collateral trauma or panic.
	<li>- Ensure both nuclear reactors remain stable and under secure, humane oversight.
</ul>
<br>
<b>SECONDARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Avoid hostile escalation with Weyland-Yutani operatives unless directly endangered.
	<li>- Preserve access routes for emergency evacuation through secondary tram tunnels.
	<li>- Disable enemy strongholds with targeted strikes and avoid unnecessary destruction of infrastructure.
</ul>
<br>
You are not just marines, you're the last line of defence for people already abandoned once.
