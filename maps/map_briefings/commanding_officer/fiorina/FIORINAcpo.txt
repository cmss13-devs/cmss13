[small]CONFIDENTIAL – USCM INTERNAL MEMORANDUM  
[b]USCM REF[/b]: 48-77-SE
[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Engagement Protocol – Fiorina Science Annex AO

Commander,  

The Fiorina Annex has violated Joint Security Order 9. Communications are down, and we have reason to believe Weyland-Yutani has lost control of its own experiments. You are to secure the site with overwhelming force and terminate all rogue assets.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Fortify a Forward Operating Base adjacent to the Lower Industrial Block.  
[*]Sweep the facility’s prison tiers, medlabs, and freight elevator junctions for hostile organisms.  
[*]Confiscate or destroy all Weyland-Yutani biological and classified equipment.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Execute crowd control protocols in inmate holding areas. Non-compliant prisoners are not to be released.  
[*]Seal shuttle hangar and deny all escape attempts by corporate or xeno-infected subjects.  
[*]Purge hive growths forming near the science wing containment zones.[/list] Minimal patience. Maximum pressure. The Corps does not recognize private interference in secure combat zones.

No mercy. No doubt,
Colonel Margaret A.W. Shanks
