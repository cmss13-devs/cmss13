<b><u>TO</u></b>: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer<br>
<b><u>SUBJECT</u></b>: Deployment Priorities &#45 Fiorina Science Annex AO<br>
<small><u>USCM REF</u>: 48-77-HM CONFIDENTIAL</small>
<hr>
Commander,<br>
<br>
The Fiorina Annex is both prison and proving ground.<br>
<br>
It is a site with human lives at its center, many of them forgotten and uncared for.<br>
<br>
WY and UA oversight may be fragmented, but your orders are not: <u>prioritize preservation, justice, and restraint.</u>
<hr>
<b>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Deploy your FOB at a location where aid and triage can be delivered to both staff and inmate survivors.
	<li>- Locate missing medical teams and security personnel last seen near the transit hub.
	<li>- Secure ethically questionable research logs and bring evidence of abuse or violations to the Almayer.
</ul>
<br>
<b>SECONDARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Avoid lethal force in prison areas unless direct threat is confirmed.
	<li>- Facilitate safe evacuation of non-hostile prisoners through upper docking platforms.
	<li>- Preserve biological storage and archive blocks for forensic review.
</ul>
<br>
Human dignity persists even in places left behind.<br>
Show Fiorina what the Corps stands for.
