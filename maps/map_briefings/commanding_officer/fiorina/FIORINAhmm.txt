[small]CONFIDENTIAL – USCM INTERNAL MEMORANDUM  
[b]USCM REF[/b]: 48-77-HM  
[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Deployment Priorities - Fiorina Science Annex AO

Commander,  

The Fiorina Annex is both prison and proving ground. It is a site with human lives at its center, many of them forgotten and uncared for. WY and UA oversight may be fragmented, but your orders are not: prioritize preservation, justice, and restraint.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Deploy your FOB at a location where aid and triage can be delivered to both staff and inmate survivors.  
[*]Locate missing medical teams and security personnel last seen near the transit hub.  
[*]Secure ethically questionable research logs and bring evidence of abuse or violations to the Almayer.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Avoid lethal force in prison areas unless direct threat is confirmed.  
[*]Facilitate safe evacuation of non-hostile prisoners through upper docking platforms.  
[*]Preserve biological storage and archive blocks for forensic review.[/list] Human dignity persists even in places left behind. Show Fiorina what the Corps stands for.

In service to justice and peace,  
Colonel Adrian Blackburn
