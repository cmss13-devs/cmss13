[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Operational Objectives - Fiorina Science Annex AO

Commander,  

You are being deployed to Fiorina Science Annex, a joint United Americas–Weyland-Yutani facility. All communications ceased 16 hours ago. Local signals suggest both penal containment and research control systems have failed.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Establish and maintain a secure Forward Operating Base near the Processing Block entry.  
[*]Locate and extract survivors, including researchers, corrections staff, and any unarmed inmates.  
[*]Secure biological samples, experiment logs, and personnel files stored in the central cryo lab and the servers.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Restore security lockdown control to isolation chambers and armory block.  
[*]Prevent spread of biohazards or prisoner breakout beyond any established perimeter.  
[*]Neutralize Xenomorph infestations located within the prison chapel or east annex crawlways.[/list] Facility jurisdiction is legally complex — proceed carefully around UA or WY markings. Detain high-risk personnel.
