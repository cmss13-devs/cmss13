<b><u>TO</u></b>: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer<br>
<b><u>SUBJECT</u></b>: Engagement Protocol &#45 Hybrisa Prospera AO<br>
<small><u>USCM REF</u>: 48-77-SE CONFIDENTIAL</small>
<hr>
Commander,<br>
<br>
Hybrisa Prospera was lost under suspicious conditions immediately following the withdrawal of TWE forces.<br>
<br>
Intelligence suggests enemy contact may have coincided with — or been accelerated by — covert corporate operations. This is now a hostile urban AO. Your task is to take control of the situation before the Empire or any other power can intervene further.
<hr>
<b>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Fortify FOB at a location which gives direct access to high-density civilian zones and corporate infrastructure.
	<li>- Eliminate suspected infestations or dangerous non-human elements in sub-city transit tunnels, sewer grids, or excavation sites near the xenocraft chamber.
	<li>- Seize and lock down all Weyland-Yutani blacksite facilities — detain or eliminate PMC personnel.
</ul>
<br>
<b>SECONDARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Prevent exfil of sensitive tech or bioweapons to off-world smugglers via the starport.
	<li>- Establish control over Hybrisa's planetary defense uplink and secure TWE depot bunkers.
	<li>- Apprehend or neutralize known CLF agitators operating in the worker districts.
</ul>
<br>
This is no longer a city. It's a contested battlespace.<br>
Secure it - fast, hard, and without ambiguity.
