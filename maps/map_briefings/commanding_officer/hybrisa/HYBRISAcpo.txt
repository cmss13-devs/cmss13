[small]CONFIDENTIAL – USCM INTERNAL MEMORANDUM  
[b]USCM REF[/b]: 48-77-SE
[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Engagement Protocol – Hybrisa Prospera AO

Commander,  

Hybrisa Prospera was lost under suspicious conditions immediately following the withdrawal of TWE forces. Intelligence suggests Xenoform contact may have coincided with — or been accelerated by — covert corporate operations. This is now a hostile urban AO. Your task is to take control of the situation before the Empire or any other power can intervene further.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Fortify FOB at a location which gives direct access to high-density civilian zones and corporate infrastructure.  
[*]Eliminate Xenomorph infestations in sub-city transit tunnels, sewer grids, or excavation sites near the xenocraft chamber.  
[*]Seize and lock down all Weyland-Yutani blacksite facilities — detain or eliminate PMC personnel.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Prevent exfil of sensitive tech or bioweapons to off-world smugglers via the starport.  
[*]Establish control over Hybrisa’s planetary defense uplink and secure TWE depot bunkers.  
[*]Apprehend or neutralize known CLF agitators operating in the worker districts.[/list] This is no longer a city. It’s a contested battlespace. Secure it — fast, hard, and without ambiguity.

No mercy. No doubt,
