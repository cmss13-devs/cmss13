[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Deployment Priorities - Hybrisa Prospera AO

Commander,  

You are about to enter one of the largest urban colonies in the Neroid Sector. Once a thriving city, Hybrisa has suffered from mounting instability, culminating in a full planetary blackout. We must treat this as both a rescue and peacekeeping operation.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Deploy FOB at a location which allows access to residential and civic medical sectors.  
[*]Locate and evacuate civilian non-combatants, with emphasis on children, wounded, and medical staff.  
[*]Secure and preserve access to the city’s emergency services control center.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Avoid damage to hospitals, shelters, and communications infrastructure.  
[*]Detain, not kill, Whiteguard PMC or CLF personnel when possible.  
[*]Offer safe surrender channels to any stranded civilian officials or miners in the industrial zones.[/list] The population may still be alive beneath the chaos. Be their protector, not their invader.

In service to justice and peace,  
Colonel Adrian Blackburn
