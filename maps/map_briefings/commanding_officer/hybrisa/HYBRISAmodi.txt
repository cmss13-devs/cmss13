[small]CONFIDENTIAL – USCM INTERNAL MEMORANDUM  
[b]USCM REF[/b]: 48-77-RI
[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Research-Oriented Objectives – Hybrisa Prospera AO

Commander,  

Hybrisa Prospera sits atop the most extensive alien structure discovery since the Derelict on LV-426. Intelligence confirms that Weyland-Yutani was conducting unauthorized excavation beneath the colony with multiple layered facilities of unknown origin. This is a high-priority recovery operation for advanced xeno-technology.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Secure a FOB near corporate transit lines and excavation zone entry.  
[*]Recover all data cores from Weyland-Yutani’s underground research chambers.  
[*]Tag and document any evidence of the xenocraft’s internal structure — avoid triggering automated systems.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Obtain DNA or biomechanical samples from Whiteguard containment facilities.  
[*]Preserve advanced medical AI housed in the city’s neurological hospital.  
[*]Trace early hive spread vectors using biometric traffic logs from spaceport scanners.[/list] Do not allow this discovery to vanish in fire and bullets. The future of humanity may rest here.

Onward through progress,
Lt. Colonel Geoffrey Lamdem
Division Logistics Commander
