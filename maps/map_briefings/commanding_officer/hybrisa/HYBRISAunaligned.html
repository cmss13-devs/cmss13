<b><u>TO</u></b>: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer<br>
<b><u>SUBJECT</u></b>: Operational Objectives &#45 Hybrisa Prospera AO<br>
<small><u>USCM REF</u>: 48-77-AQ  CONFIDENTIAL</small>
<hr>
Commander,<br>
<br>
You are tasked with responding to a complete communications blackout from Hybrisa Prospera, a major colony on LV-759 with a population in the tens of thousands.<br>
<br>
The colony hosts critical mineral refining infrastructure, a major spaceport, and is a key transit hub for the Neroid Sector.<br>
<br>
USCMC intervention was requested jointly by the Three World Empire and Weyland-Yutani following the sudden loss of all contact with planetary authorities.
<hr>
<b>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Establish a secure Forward Operating Base near the central transit loop and spaceport junction.
	<li>- Locate and recover key government, security, and medical personnel from the city center and outlying medical complex.
	<li>- Secure classified Weyland-Yutani research data and prevent its exfiltration by third parties.
</ul>
<br>
<b>SECONDARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Restore control over city-wide power and traffic systems via transit control or engineering hubs.
	<li>- Investigate rumors of a buried alien structure south of the colony. Initiate recon but avoid deep penetration without support.
	<li>- Neutralize or detain any paramilitary elements operating in the city's lower districts or corporate zones.
</ul>
<br>
Tread carefully. This is a population center and political flashpoint.<br>
Collateral damage must be minimized where feasible.
