[small]CONFIDENTIAL – USCM INTERNAL MEMORANDUM  
[b]USCM REF[/b]: 48-77-AQ  
[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Operational Objectives - Hybrisa Prospera AO

Commander,  

You are tasked with responding to a complete communications blackout from Hybrisa Prospera, a major colony on LV-759 with a population in the tens of thousands. The colony hosts critical mineral refining infrastructure, a major spaceport, and is a key transit hub for the Neroid Sector. USCMC intervention was requested jointly by the Three World Empire and Weyland-Yutani following the sudden loss of all contact with planetary authorities.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Establish a secure Forward Operating Base near the central transit loop and spaceport junction.  
[*]Locate and recover key government, security, and medical personnel from the city center and outlying medical complex.  
[*]Secure classified Weyland-Yutani research data and prevent its exfiltration by third parties.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Restore control over city-wide power and traffic systems via transit control or engineering hubs.  
[*]Investigate rumors of a buried alien structure south of the colony — initiate recon but avoid deep penetration without support.  
[*]Neutralize or detain any paramilitary elements operating in the city’s lower districts or corporate zones.[/list] Tread carefully. This is a population center and political flashpoint. Collateral damage must be minimized where feasible.
