<small>CONFIDENTIAL – USCM INTERNAL MEMORANDUM<br>
<b>USCM REF</b>: 48-77-SE<br>
<date><br>

<b>TO</b>: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer<br>
<b>SUBJECT</b>: Engagement Protocol – Kutjevo Refinery AO<br>

Commander,

Kutjevo isn’t just a bottling plant — it is a monopoly on Dykuma I’s aquifers. If Xeno infestation spreads through the water system, it could threaten the entire biosphere and spark large scale ecological collapse. You are tasked with rapid containment and infrastructure denial.
<hr>
<div>
    <b>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Fortify a FOB positioned to defend access to central filtration shafts.</li>
		<li>Purge all Xeno activity from aquifer intake tunnels and sublevel caverns.</li>
		<li>Shut down or secure all refinery systems to prevent external contamination or misuse.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>

<b>SECONDARY OBJECTIVES</b>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>Neutralize any hostile survivors attempting to sabotage or hijack Weyland-Yutani shipment equipment.</li>
			<li>Destroy wildlife showing Xeno-related mutation near the water reservoir.</li>
			<li>Collapse compromised tunnel systems if hives are detected near deepwater zones.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	This is not an asset. It’s a vector for invasion. Lock it down. Burn what you can’t save.
