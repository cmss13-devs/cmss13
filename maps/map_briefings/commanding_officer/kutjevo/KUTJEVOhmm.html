<b><u>TO</u></b>: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer<br>
<b><u>SUBJECT</u></b>: Deployment Priorities &#45 Kutjevo Refinery AO<br>
<small><u>USCM REF</u>: 48-77-HM CONFIDENTIAL</small>
<hr>
Commander,<br>
<br>
Kutjevo's people rely on the aquifer not just for survival, but for hope.<br>
<br>
Whatever threat has befallen the refinery, our mission must center on protecting the 2,000 workers and preserving the natural balance of this fragile desert world.
<hr>
<b>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Establish a non-disruptive FOB at near the botanical block and medical suite.
	<li>- Locate and rescue non-combatant refinery personnel sheltering in administration or safety control stations.
	<li>- Preserve environmental monitoring and water flow systems from deliberate or accidental damage.
</ul>
<br>
<b>SECONDARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Use nonlethal deterrents where possible in case of worker unrest or confusion.
	<li>- Prevent aquifer runoff into structurally compromised tunnels or unknown subterranean spaces.
	<li>- Coordinate evac efforts through Weyland-Yutani's shuttlepad access corridor.
</ul>
<br>
Remember: this is their home, their water, and their lives.<br>
Treat the terrain and its people with care.
