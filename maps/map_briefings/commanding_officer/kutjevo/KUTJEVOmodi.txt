[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Research-Oriented Objectives – Kutjevo Refinery AO

Commander,  

Preliminary data suggests Kutjevo’s aquifer system may have undergone rapid biological shifts following the blackout. You are to conduct a recovery operation for both biological and hydrological data. Avoid ecological collapse. Do not contaminate the aquifer.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Establish a FOB to enable secure ingress to testing stations and storage silos.  
[*]Collect tissue and water samples from areas showing Xenoform interaction with the ecosystem.  
[*]Recover mineral filtration logs, biotech experiments, and aquifer microbiome studies from Weyland-Yutani archives.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Deploy remotely operated equipment to sub-aquifer vents for observation of any hive-nest overlaps.  
[*]Extract contaminated water samples before purification occurs.  
[*]Capture wild fauna showing behavioral anomalies for xenogenetic analysis.[/list] This may be the first large-scale ecosystem modified by Xenomorph presence that we've discovered. Document everything.

Onward through progress,
Lt. Colonel Geoffrey Lamdem
Division Logistics Commander
