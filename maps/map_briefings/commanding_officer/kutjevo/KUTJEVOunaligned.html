A full loss of contact occurred 36 hours ago.<br>

<b>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES</b>

<ul>
	<li>- Establish a Forward Operating Base adjacent to the water extraction pipeline and purification nexus.
	<li>- Recover civilian personnel or refinery workers sheltering near the primary reservoir control deck or filtration chambers.
	<li>- Secure refinery data servers and shipment logs from central administration.
</ul>
<br>
<b>SECONDARY OBJECTIVES</b>
