<b><u>TO</u></b>: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer<br>
<b><u>SUBJECT</u></b>: Deployment Priorities &#45 LV-624 AO<br>
<small><u>USCM REF</u>: 48-77-HM CONFIDENTIAL</small>
<hr>
Commander,<br>
<br>
LV-624 was once a thriving example of colonial promise. Now, it has gone silent under suspicious and tragic circumstances.<br>
<br>
Your mission is to restore order with precision and empathy.<br>
<br>
Civilian lives may still hang in the balance.
<hr>
<b>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Establish a secure and minimally intrusive Forward Operating Base near important colonial infrastructure.
	<li>- Locate and extract any surviving colonists, researchers, or visiting personnel from the lower colony.
	<li>- Recover Weyland-Yutani data carefully, ensuring no disruption to local environmental or infrastructure systems.
</ul>
<br>
<b>SECONDARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Preserve remaining habitats, hydroponics, and clean water systems.
	<li>- Evacuate or safeguard non-combatants from colonial dwellings and attached workplaces.
	<li>- Use nonlethal suppression methods wherever possibleâ€”prioritize warning and deterrence over immediate force.
</ul>
<br>
This operation is as much about restoration as defense.<br>
Demonstrate the Corps' capacity for compassion and courage.
