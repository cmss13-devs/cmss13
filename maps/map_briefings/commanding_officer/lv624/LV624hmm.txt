[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Deployment Priorities - LV-624 AO

Commander,  

LV-624 was once a thriving example of colonial promise. Now, it has gone silent under suspicious and tragic circumstances. Your mission is to restore order with precision and empathy. Civilian lives may still hang in the balance.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Establish a secure and minimally intrusive Forward Operating Base near important colonial infrastructure.  
[*]Locate and extract any surviving colonists, researchers, or visiting personnel from the lower colony.  
[*]Recover Weyland-Yutani data carefully, ensuring no disruption to local environmental or infrastructure systems.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Preserve remaining habitats, hydroponics, and clean water systems.  
[*]Evacuate or safeguard non-combatants from colonial dwellings and attached workplaces.  
[*]Use nonlethal suppression methods wherever possible—prioritize warning and deterrence over immediate force.[/list] This operation is as much about restoration as defense. Demonstrate the Corps’ capacity for compassion and courage.

In service to justice and peace,  
Colonel Adrian Blackburn
