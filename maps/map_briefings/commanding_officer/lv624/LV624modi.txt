[small]CONFIDENTIAL – USCM INTERNAL MEMORANDUM  
[b]USCM REF[/b]: 48-77-RI
[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Research-Oriented Objectives – LV-624 AO

Commander,  

LV-624 is of particular interest due to preliminary signals suggesting advanced biohazard mutation and unauthorized research development. This mission represents an opportunity for significant scientific return—[i]if[/i] handled with appropriate containment and data recovery protocols.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Establish an outpost at the central comms array for secure uplink and logistics coordination.  
[*]Recover sample containers, terminal logs, or subject recordings from the Lower Colony’s medlab and R&D wings.  
[*]Secure and preserve all Weyland-Yutani equipment, including blackbox modules and specimen containment cases.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Avoid collateral damage to systems needed for research viability (i.e., hydroponics, reactors, biospheres).  
[*]Identify and log Xenomorph variant behavior with visual confirmation—live sample preferred but not required.  
[*]Recover or account for any prototype hardware used during last Weyland-Yutani cycle.[/list] Data matters more than firepower. Extract what you can. Document what you can't. And bring it all home.

Onward through progress,
Lt. Colonel Geoffrey Lamdem
Division Logistics Commander
