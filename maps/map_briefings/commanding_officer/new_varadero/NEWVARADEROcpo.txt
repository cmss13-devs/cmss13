[small]CONFIDENTIAL – USCM INTERNAL MEMORANDUM  
[b]USCM REF[/b]: 48-77-SE
[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Engagement Protocol – New Varadero AO

Commander,  

New Varadero has become a liability. A xenoform spacecraft has crash-landed near the Latin American Colonial Navy base. Predictably, LACN personnel were overrun or compromised. You are to enter this AO with full authority and suppress all threats, regardless of flag or origin.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Establish fortified FOB overseeing the crash site and garrison compound.  
[*]Terminate all active non-human combatants.  
[*]Seize the alien vessel and destroy any hostile or uncooperative LACN holdouts.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Disable surveillance and transmitter towers to prevent civilian footage leaks.  
[*]Purge local biosigns in surrounding jungle and cave systems.  
[*]Collect proof of foreign tampering or weapons trafficking through the site.[/list] This is not a rescue. This is a lockdown. Let the wreckage tell no stories.

No mercy. No doubt,
Colonel Margaret A.W. Shanks
