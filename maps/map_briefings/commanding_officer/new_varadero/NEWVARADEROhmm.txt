[small]CONFIDENTIAL – USCM INTERNAL MEMORANDUM  
[b]USCM REF[/b]: 48-77-HM  
[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Deployment Priorities - New Varadero AO

Commander,  

A crash of an apparent extraterrestrial vessel near New Varadero triggered a full communications blackout. While local records confirm the presence of at least one non-human entity, the political situation with the Latin American Colonial Navy must be treated with the utmost diplomatic care. Avoid escalation. Seek survivors. Do not allow a rescue to become an incident.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Deploy FOB at a secure location, taking care not to disturb LACN fortifications.  
[*]Locate and secure LACN personnel in medbay, barracks, or command center — prioritize cooperation.  
[*]Secure and shield any civilians exposed to the alien vessel or its occupants.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Open communication with remaining LACN officers if possible. De-escalate.  
[*]Minimize destruction of local structures and infrastructure.  
[*]Prevent technology or biological contamination from affecting the wider colony.[/list] This is not about conquest, it’s about responsibility. Show them what integrity looks like.

In service to justice and peace,
