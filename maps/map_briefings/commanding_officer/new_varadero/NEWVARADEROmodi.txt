[b]USCM REF[/b]: 48-77-RI
[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Research-Oriented Objectives – New Varadero AO

Commander,  

We have confirmation that a highly advanced extraterrestrial spacecraft has crash-landed at New Varadero, an LACN outpost. You are ordered to recover alien technology, biological traces, and environmental data intact and uncompromised. Time is limited. Every other power will want what lies in that wreck.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Deploy FOB at a location which provides a clear route to the vessel and LACN tech bunkers.  
[*]Recover as much intact alien material (armor, tools, DNA, recordings) as possible.  
[*]Secure blacksite data servers within the LACN command structure and flag all contact logs.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Avoid structural damage to the vessel — document its propulsion, hull, and weapons systems.  
[*]Track non-human movements using biometric trace systems left in caves or power conduits.  
[*]Preserve jungle biome as evidence of any non-human interference.[/list] Bring back proof. Bring back brilliance. Bring back [b]everything[/b].

Onward through progress,
Lt. Colonel Geoffrey Lamdem
Division Logistics Commander
