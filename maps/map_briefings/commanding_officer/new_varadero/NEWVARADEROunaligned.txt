[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Operational Objectives - New Varadero AO

Commander,  

New Varadero is an active Latin American Colonial Navy (LACN) military outpost located on the outer rim. Seismic and visual satellite tracking confirm that a non-terrestrial craft crash-landed at the site four days ago. Contact with the garrison was lost shortly thereafter. Your mission is to assess the situation and restore control.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Establish Forward Operating Base near the northern perimeter of the LACN command post.  
[*]Secure the crash site and assess the nature and threat of the vessel — unknown hostile presence likely.  
[*]Locate any LACN survivors and render aid.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Prevent looting or tampering with alien tech by USCM personnel.  
[*]Isolate the vessel from power or signal transmission pathways.  
[*]Eliminate any confirmed hostile xenoforms or non-human entities.[/list] Expect resistance. Expect irregularities. Use your best judgment in an unconventional AO.
