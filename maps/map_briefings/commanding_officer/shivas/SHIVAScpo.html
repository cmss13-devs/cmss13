<b><u>TO</u></b>: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer<br>
<b><u>SUBJECT</u></b>: Engagement Protocol &#45 Shivas Snowball AO<br>
<small><u>USCM REF</u>: 48-77-SE CONFIDENTIAL</small>
<hr>
Commander,<br>
<br>
Weyland-Yutani's research installation has gone dark in the middle of one of the coldest and most desolate planets in the Drift.<br>
<br>
The nature of their research remains classified, but the loss of all contact, including with internal security personnel, is cause for immediate concern.<br>
<br>
You are authorized to enter and secure by force.
<hr>
<b>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Establish a fortified FOB with clear fields of fire toward excavation sites.
	<li>- Eliminate threats and reestablish control over both surface and subsurface structures.
	<li>- Seize R&D vaults, armories, and power junctions before sabotage or data wipes occur.
</ul>
<br>
<b>SECONDARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Destroy Weyland-Yutani field labs that cannot be secured.
	<li>- Monitor for biohazard vectors or contamination reports.
	<li>- Ensure no survivors escape without full debrief and inspection.
</ul>
<br>
<u>Do not trust anyone on-site.</u><br>
If the company called it a “weather station,” it's probably a lab.
