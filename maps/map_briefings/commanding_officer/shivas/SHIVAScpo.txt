[small]CONFIDENTIAL – USCM INTERNAL MEMORANDUM  
[b]USCM REF[/b]: 48-77-SE
[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Engagement Protocol – Shivas Snowball AO

Commander,  

Weyland-Yutani’s research installation has gone dark in the middle of one of the coldest and most desolate planets in the Drift. The nature of their research remains classified, but the loss of all contact, including with internal security personnel, is cause for immediate concern. You are authorized to enter and secure by force.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Establish a fortified FOB with clear fields of fire toward excavation sites.
[*]Eliminate threats and reestablish control over both surface and subsurface structures.  
[*]Seize R&D vaults, armories, and power junctions before sabotage or data wipes occur.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Destroy Weyland-Yutani field labs that cannot be secured.  
[*]Monitor for biohazard vectors or contamination reports.  
[*]Ensure no survivors escape without full debrief and inspection.[/list] Do not trust anyone on-site. If the company called it a “weather station,” it’s probably a lab.

No mercy. No doubt,
Colonel Margaret A.W. Shanks
