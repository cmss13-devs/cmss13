<b><u>TO</u></b>: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer<br>
<b><u>SUBJECT</u></b>: Deployment Priorities &#45 Shivas Snowball AO<br>
<small><u>USCM REF</u>: 48-77-HM CONFIDENTIAL</small>
<hr>
Commander,<br>
<br>
Shiva-1 is a small Weyland-Yutani research station on a frozen, isolated world.<br>
<br>
It was self-sustaining and, until recently, entirely peaceful.<br>
<br>
Its sudden silence raises concerns about equipment failure, medical emergencies, or environmental catastrophe.<br>
<br>
<u>You are being sent not as occupiers, but as investigators.</u>
<hr>
<b>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Deploy a Forward Operating Base on site, avoiding damage to entry tunnels or habitat domes.
	<li>- Find and evacuate all surviving scientists, engineers, or maintenance crews.
	<li>- Protect research archives from weather damage or corporate erasure.
</ul>
<br>
<b>SECONDARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Ensure heating and oxygenation in residential quarters are restored.
	<li>- Handle unarmed personnel with non-lethal methods. Prioritize diplomacy.
	<li>- Scan and report suspicious excavation zones without destroying them.
</ul>
<br>
Every scientist down there had a family, a purpose, and a life worth saving.<br>
Don't forget that.
