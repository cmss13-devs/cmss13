[small]CONFIDENTIAL – USCM INTERNAL MEMORANDUM  
[b]USCM REF[/b]: 48-77-HM  
[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Deployment Priorities - Shivas Snowball AO

Commander,  

Shiva-1 is a small Weyland-Yutani research station on a frozen, isolated world. It was self-sustaining and, until recently, entirely peaceful. Its sudden silence raises concerns about equipment failure, medical emergencies, or environmental catastrophe. You are being sent not as occupiers, but as investigators.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Deploy a Forward Operating Base on site, avoiding damage to entry tunnels or habitat domes.  
[*]Find and evacuate all surviving scientists, engineers, or maintenance crews.  
[*]Protect research archives from weather damage or corporate erasure.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Ensure heating and oxygenation in residential quarters are restored.  
[*]Handle unarmed personnel with non-lethal methods — prioritize diplomacy.  
[*]Scan and report suspicious excavation zones without destroying them.[/list] Every scientist down there had a family, a purpose, and a life worth saving. Don’t forget that.

In service to justice and peace,
