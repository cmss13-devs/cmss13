[small]CONFIDENTIAL – USCM INTERNAL MEMORANDUM  
[b]USCM REF[/b]: 48-77-RI
[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Research-Oriented Objectives – Shivas Snowball AO

Commander,  

Shiva-1 was an experimental cold-zone lab with excavation capabilities. Most of its sensor output was classified or suppressed by Weyland-Yutani internal channels. We believe the blackout may relate to something unearthed beneath the ice, and we need to find out what.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Secure a FOB with direct access to sub-zero labs and excavation boreholes.  
[*]Recover cryogenic samples, dig logs, and deep-ice anomaly readings.  
[*]Retrieve all preserved biological material. Priority is to be given to frozen or dormant forms.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Scan any hive-like growths near glacial walls or thermal anomalies.  
[*]Recover excavation drones or control interfaces for analysis.  
[*]Document sudden heating or thawing patterns in permafrost tunnels.[/list] You may be standing atop an incredibly old and well preserved Xenoform. Don't miss it.

Onward through progress,
Lt. Colonel Geoffrey Lamdem
Division Logistics Commander
