Commander,<br>
<br>
A Weyland-Yutani research outpost ceased all contact 72 hours ago.<br>
<br>
Located on an uncolonized ice world in the Altalune Drift, the facility was used primarily for geologic and subzero climate studies.<br>
<br>
The outpost is designed for long-term habitation, with full life-support and deep-field excavation equipment.<br>
<br>
<u>Civilian presence is expected.</u>
<hr>
<b>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Establish a Forward Operating Base  near the main entrance to the primary habitat block.
	<li>- Locate and evacuate surviving staff, particularly those in dormitory, medical, or recreational commons.
	<li>- Secure all communications logs and R&D backups stored in the data center or server room.
</ul>
<br>
<b>SECONDARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Restore power and environmental controls to the facility if intact.
	<li>- Sweep lower excavation areas for physical hazards or collapse.
	<li>- Log environmental anomalies or sudden temperature drops.
</ul>
<br>
Prepare for low visibility, extreme cold, and infrastructure degradation.<br>
Weather and loss of heating will be ongoing threats.
