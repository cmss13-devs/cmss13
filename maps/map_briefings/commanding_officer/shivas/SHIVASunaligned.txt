[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Operational Objectives - Shivas Snowball AO

Commander,  

A Weyland-Yutani research outpost ceased all contact 72 hours ago. Located on an uncolonized ice world in the Altalune Drift, the facility was used primarily for geologic and subzero climate studies. The outpost is designed for long-term habitation, with full life-support and deep-field excavation equipment. Civilian presence is expected.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Establish a Forward Operating Base  near the main entrance to the primary habitat block.  
[*]Locate and evacuate surviving staff, particularly those in dormitory, medical, or recreational commons.  
[*]Secure all communications logs and R&D backups stored in the data center or server room.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Restore power and environmental controls to the facility if intact.  
[*]Sweep lower excavation areas for physical hazards or collapse.  
[*]Log environmental anomalies or sudden temperature drops.[/list] Prepare for low visibility, extreme cold, and infrastructure degradation. Weather and loss of heating will be ongoing threats.
