[small]CONFIDENTIAL – USCM INTERNAL MEMORANDUM  
[b]USCM REF[/b]: 48-77-SE
[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Engagement Protocol – Sorokyne Strata AO

Commander,  

You are entering a politically compromised AO. Sorokyne’s two outposts are now presumed overrun. Intelligence suggests the UPP mining site may have harbored foreign operatives. Do not mistake this for a rescue mission. This is a containment operation.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Establish a FOB in a location that secures high ground over UPP infrastructure and shaft entrances.  
[*]Purge Xenomorph threats from central mining corridors and any comms relays.
[*]Confiscate or destroy any UPP communications logs, databanks, or experimental machinery.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Interrogate or neutralize UPP-aligned personnel resisting disarmament.  
[*]Demolish sensors or research modules co-developed with known socialist regimes.  
[*]Secure transport networks to prevent retreat or external transmission.[/list] You are cleared for force. No cooperation is expected. End this with clarity.

No mercy. No doubt,
Colonel Margaret A.W. Shanks
