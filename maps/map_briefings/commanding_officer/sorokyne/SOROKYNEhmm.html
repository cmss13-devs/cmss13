<b><u>TO</u></b>: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer<br>
<b><u>SUBJECT</u></b>: Deployment Priorities &#45 Sorokyne Strata AO<br>
<small><u>USCM REF</u>: 48-77-HM CONFIDENTIAL</small>
<hr>
Commander,<br>
<br>
Sorokyne Strata on LV-976 was originally developed by Jùtóu Combine, a state-owned enterprise of the Union of Progressive Peoples, after its discovery by the CANC in 2110.<br>
<br>
Following the Dog War in 2166, the UPP formally annexed the colony and continues to operate its lithium, carbon, and silicon mines through Jùtóu oversight.<br>
<br>
Your mission is to protect civilian life and avert any escalation that could inflame tensions between the UPP and United Americas.
<hr>
<b>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Construct a FOB aimed at minimizing disruption to daily mining operations.
	<li>- Provide medical and logistical assistance to miners, their families, and local workers regardless of affiliation.
	<li>- Open respectful communication with UPP Army, Cosmos Exploration Corps, and PAP security forces to coordinate relief and evacuation if required.
</ul>
<br>
<b>SECONDARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Stabilize key infrastructure, power, water, and habitat systems to ensure civilian safety.
	<li>- Document humanitarian needs and living conditions for intergovernmental review.
	<li>- Avoid unnecessary confrontation with UPP personnel; engage only in self-defense.
</ul>
<br>
Our presence must reassure, not intimidate.<br>
Act with professionalism and compassion to safeguard lives and maintain this fragile peace.
