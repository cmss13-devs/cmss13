[b]USCM REF[/b]: 48-77-HM  
[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Deployment Priorities - Sorokyne Strata AO

Commander,  

The situation on Sorokyne Strata is delicate. You are tasked with preventing escalation between Weyland-Yutani scientists and UPP miners while responding to a potential biohazard event. Avoid politicizing the crisis. Save who you can.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Construct a FOB with sightlines to both civilian outposts.  
[*]Locate surviving medical or geological staff in the outpost's main structure and attached bunkrooms.  
[*]Safely recover scientific logs detailing early biological encounters or mining anomalies.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Ensure UPP workers are treated with parity under interstellar humanitarian codes.  
[*]Use non-lethal containment on hostile actors unless directly endangered.  
[*]Preserve power and life support between the two outposts to prevent civilian harm.[/list] This is not a battleground. It is a workplace turned catastrophe. Lead with restraint.

In service to justice and peace,  
Colonel Adrian Blackburn
