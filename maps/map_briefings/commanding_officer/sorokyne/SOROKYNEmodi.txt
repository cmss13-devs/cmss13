[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Research-Oriented Objectives – Sorokyne Strata AO

Commander,  

Sorokyne Strata's twin installations were engaged in bio-mineral research, atmospheric simulations, and deep-bore drilling. This mission is flagged for high-value recovery. Proceed as an inter-facility salvage expedition with hostile containment protocol.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Deploy FOB at a location which grants access to the eastern mineral shaft and sensor relay grid.  
[*]Recover sample logs, atmospheric readings, and bore site data from both research and mining hubs.  
[*]Extract any Xeno-organic materials found embedded in processed lithium silicates.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Secure cross-linked neural mapping files shared between UPP and WY terminals.  
[*]Recover artificial limb prototypes from the medtech sub-wing.  
[*]Track hive behavior near junctions of the two colonies—document transition and migration patterns.[/list] Avoid needless damage to terminals. This facility may hold answers, not just enemies.

Onward through progress,
