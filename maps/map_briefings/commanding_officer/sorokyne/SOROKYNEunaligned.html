Commander,<br>
<br>
Sorokyne Strata is a jointly operated site, split between a Weyland-Yutani research installation and a mining colony administered by Union of Progressive Peoples contractors.<br>
<br>
<u>Both have gone dark.</u><br>
<br>
Your orders are to secure both installations and assess threat levels.

<b>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Establish a Forward Operating Base at a location which offers access to both the UPP mining complex and research dormitories.
	<li>- Locate and recover civilians or staff from both facilities. Focus on scientific personnel and miners.
	<li>- Secure biological samples, dig logs, and lab drives from the geological research wing.
</ul>
<br>
<b>SECONDARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Ensure reactor safety at both outposts to avoid chain-collapse.
	<li>- Report presence of UPP military advisors or hostile activity.
	<li>- Sweep caves and sublevels for signs of Xenomorph infestation. Neutralize as necessary.
