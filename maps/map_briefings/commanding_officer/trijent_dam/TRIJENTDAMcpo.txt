[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Engagement Protocol – Trijent Dam AO

Commander,  

You are being inserted at a critical economic chokepoint. The Trijent Dam and lithium transfer ports power the Tritium refining supply chain. Their failure is unacceptable. Your task: reclaim, hold, and eliminate.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Deploy your FOB at a location overseeing the loading bay and telecommunications.  
[*]Purge hostile elements from the dam’s structural interior and lithium storage facility.  
[*]Secure all corporate Tritium isotope caches for strategic redirection.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Eliminate unauthorized personnel operating dam controls or pilfering lithium crates.  
[*]Secure the water purification facilities dwto prevent hostile flanking from water intake valves.  
[*]Collapse or seal off hive infestations detected in auxiliary coolant or vent channels.[/list] This is not a colony to be liberated. It is an asset to be defended with force. Hold the line.

No mercy. No doubt,
Colonel Margaret A.W. Shanks
