<b><u>TO</u></b>: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer<br>
<b><u>SUBJECT</u></b>: Deployment Priorities &#45 Trijent Dam AO<br>
<small><u>USCM REF</u>: 48-77-HM CONFIDENTIAL</small>
<hr>
Commander,<br>
<br>
Trijent Dam is more than a generator. It's the lifeline of Oxley's Butte and its people.<br>
<br>
Our top priority is restoring critical utilities while protecting the workers who once kept this system running.<br>
<br>
Minimize harm, maximize assistance.
<hr>
<b>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Establish your FOB to enable rapid access to the generator deck and evac platform.
	<li>- Locate and rescue unarmed technicians, engineers, or miners trapped near the lithium refining laboratory.
	<li>- Recover safety override data and power grid logs to restore energy to the colony.
</ul>
<br>
<b>SECONDARY OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>- Avoid structural damage to spillway towers or pipeline junctions near living quarters.
	<li>- Coordinate medical aid in the canteen and warehouse shelter zones.
	<li>- Evacuate surviving workers via the dam’s western catwalks or water lift tunnels.
</ul>
<br>
This facility was built by people.<br>
Don't let their work or their lives drown in silence.
