[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Deployment Priorities - Trijent Dam AO

Commander,  

Trijent Dam is more than a generator. It’s the lifeline of Oxley’s Butte and its people. Our top priority is restoring critical utilities while protecting the workers who once kept this system running. Minimize harm, maximize assistance.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Establish your FOB to enable rapid access to the generator deck and evac platform.  
[*]Locate and rescue unarmed technicians, engineers, or miners trapped near the lithium refining laboratory.  
[*]Recover safety override data and power grid logs to restore energy to the colony.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Avoid structural damage to spillway towers or pipeline junctions near living quarters.  
[*]Coordinate medical aid in the canteen and warehouse shelter zones.  
[*]Evacuate surviving workers via the dam’s western catwalks or water lift tunnels.[/list] This facility was built by people. Don’t let their work or their lives drown in silence.

In service to justice and peace,  
Colonel Adrian Blackburn
