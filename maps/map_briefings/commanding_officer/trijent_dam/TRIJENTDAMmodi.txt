[small]CONFIDENTIAL – USCM INTERNAL MEMORANDUM  
[b]USCM REF[/b]: 48-77-RI
[date]

[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Research-Oriented Objectives – Trijent Dam AO

Commander,  

Trijent Dam contains high-priority experimental tech: isotope compressors, real-time lithium sensors, and Weyland-Yutani efficiency algorithms. We suspect Xenomorph exposure to Tritium waste may have catalyzed variant behavior. Document it.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Deploy your FOB at a location that maximizes access to any lithium or tritium storage facilities.
[*]Recover mining telemetry, Tritium extraction records, and mutated organism bio-signs.  
[*]Secure vent camera logs and pump reactor feedback loops for behavioral study.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Preserve cryostorage and pipeflow AI modules located near the western dam maintenance controls.  
[*]Tag and track any hive formations around the coolant reservoir or outflow chute.  
[*]Extract or study hostile biology found near contaminated water treatment zones.[/list] Study the hive. Don’t just kill it. Knowledge is the payload here.

Onward through progress,
Lt. Colonel Geoffrey Lamdem
Division Logistics Commander
