[b]TO[/b]: Commanding Officer, USS Almayer
[b]SUBJECT[/b]: Operational Objectives - Trijent Dam AO

Commander,  

You are ordered to deploy to Trijent Dam, a hydroelectric power installation supplying Oxley’s Butte and its lithium export lanes. The colony lost contact following seismic irregularities and a sharp drop in power output. Expect hostile resistance and terrain instability.

[b]PRIMARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Establish and secure a Forward Operating Base that enables you easy access to the turbine control complex.  
[*]Recover surviving maintenance personnel and security teams stationed along the dam interior and technical storage.
[*]Retrieve engineering logs and lithium transport manifests from the operations terminal and export pad.[/list]
[b]SECONDARY OBJECTIVES[/b][list][*]Restore power flow to the lower generator rooms to reactivate water purification systems.  
[*]Prevent damage to lithium isotope storage—potential for secondary contamination.  
[*]Neutralize any hostiles occupying the dam itself or central access bridge.[/list] Expect high humidity, low visibility, and possible water contamination. Proceed with caution.
