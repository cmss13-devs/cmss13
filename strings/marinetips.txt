You can link plasteel barricades together using a crowbar. First click one, and then click one adjacent. Repeat as needed.
A lone marine is a dead marine and a happy xeno. Stick together!
Watch out for friendly fire. Make sure you're not walking into anyone's firing line, and make sure no one else is in yours!
Be mindful when using hand grenades. Getting stunned or knocked over after priming a grenade will drop it at your feet. This is obviously very dangerous for not only you, but your friends as well.
Reflective walls will bounce back non-IFF bullets, including rockets. Try not to shoot them.
Vary your loadout! Doing the same thing every round gets old fast. Try out the pistols, or carry flares.
Be careful when firing an Orbital Bombardment, Close Air Support, or the Mortar. Make sure you're not about to blow up the entire marine push.
The Orbital Bombardment is always closer than it looks.
Never inject a marine you haven't scanned! You might overdose them; ESPECIALLY so with an emergency autoinjector.
Check perma-dead marines (skull icon on medhud) for useful gear, such as webbings, AP ammo, or binoculars.
Always check for traps beneath loose objects - it could save your life!
Bring a fire extinguisher, it might just save someone's life. They can remove flames that block a push, remove acid from other marines, as well as put out people on fire.

If another marine is stunned, you can click on them with help intent with an open hand to shake them up faster.
No round has ever been won behind a barricade. Apart from the ones that have.

More dakka is not good when it is directed towards your teammates.

An FOB is as strong as its weakest part. Secure all flanks, remember that walls can be pried open.
Flamethrowers: Green fire is weak but has a lot of utility, such as melting through armor and being instantly extinguishable. Queens and Ravagers are flameproof. Most flamethrower damage comes from the initial burst, not the flame on the ground. Don't forget you have an underbarrel extinguisher.
CPR extends the defib timer on dead marines. It can be done by clicking the dead marine on help intent with an open hand. Make sure to get the rhythm correct!

You can hold a bayonet or throwing knife on your mask slot. Always be prepared.
Xenomorphs can't apply huggers to marines if they're on fire.
Dragging a Nanomed onto yourself instantly gives a Health Analyzer report. Always know what's wrong with you.

Blood loss can lead to hunger, which can slow you down. Make sure you're always full after taking a beating.
Resin structures are weaker to melee than they are to bullets. Take out your knives!
Researchers can make pressurized canister pouches, which can contain up to 480 reagents, and contain custom injectors that can be easily used by privates.
When fighting xenomorphs, don't aim for the head - It won't increase damage against anyone but your fellow marines.
Don't forget to set the Anti-Aircraft Gun!
Scavenging attachments (or other things) from dead marines isn't bad practice, as long as you make sure they're actually dead first.
When receiving a supply crate drop from requisitions, make sure to move the crate before opening it - Otherwise subsequent supply crates will be hidden beneath it!
If a grenade comes your way, hit the deck! Lying down will reduce damage and let you dodge any shrapnel flying overhead.

By right clicking your medical belt and selecting "toggle belt mode", you can take pills out of bottles by simply clicking them once.
You can put screwdrivers, cigarettes, and some other things in your second ear slot!
Pilots : there is one of each engine upgrade in the hangar at the start of the round, saving you the point cost of having to print out a pair of each.
You can use a hand labeler (as found in squad prep rooms) to name your equipment and make it less likely to be stolen.
You can use a health analyser in hand (Z key) to check the last scan readout from it.
Holocards are a useful triage tool for doctors and medics. Ensure you assign them (examine the marine with shift-click and select an appropriate holocard) to marines who have taken damage that cannot be healed without surgery. (Hint : major organ damage or larval infection = red card!)
Escape pods are designed for only three occupants - more than that, or if a larger xenomorph is in the pod, and it will malfunction and blow up on launch.
A misloaded OB can deviate severely from the intended target area - ensure you load them correctly!
The XO and CO are trained in powerloader use and engineering, and can load the OB.
You can change what your SL tracker beacon is tracking by right clicking on your headset and clicking "Switch Tracker Target".
Boilers emit light - not every glow from around the corner is friendly!
You can carry a variety of items inside your helmet - from gauze and cigarettes to flares and screwdrivers.
CIC staff can track every USCM-aligned person via the suit sensors console and overwatch console - useful for finding escaped prisoners or dead marines.

Remember that you need to put a defibrillator's paddles away in order to store it.
W-Y PMCs do not have marine IFF. Don't fire smartguns through them!
To talk on multiple radio channels at once, put a COMMA [,] before your message and add up to four prefixes. E.g, ,abcd talks on all squad channels at once.

Armor piercing ammunition does less damage to unarmored targets.

Painkillers do not stack. Only the strongest has any effect.
Intel Officers can be put in a squad by going to CIC and requesting it.
Any marine can perform CPR. On dead marines, this will increase the time they have until they become unrevivable.

You can check the landing zone as a marine in the status panel.
Functioning night vision goggles can be recharged with batteries. Broken night vision goggles can be repaired by an Engineer with a screwdriver. Not the loadout ones though, those are unfixable and unchargeable.
You can put a pistol belt on your suit slot. (Just grab a rifle instead..)
Alt-clicking the Squad Leader tracker lets you track your fireteam leader instead.

Armor has insulative properties - taking it off will help you cool off and take less damage faster if you've been set on fire.
Both foldable cades & plasteel cades if loosened and folded down can be transported in crates! In this way, you can use the crate as a portable breach-repair kit, or dragged (or carried via Powerloader) to an unsecure area for quick defensive set up.
The fuel tank pouch doesn't just carry fuel for an incinerator- they can also carry full-size extinguishers. Toolbelts & tool pouches also may hold miniature extinguishers.
