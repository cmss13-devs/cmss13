Acid pillars can be sneakily placed next to a door in order to surprise marines.
Alien structures like clusters, walls, or pillars are absolutely vital to your victory, be it as cover or to delay and funnel marines.
Always thank your drones and hivelords for supporting the hive!
Don't underestimate survivors. They have no armor but that makes them very fast, they're inherently hardier than marines and have various tricks up their sleeves.
While the Queen is de-ovied, the hive does not gain evolution points.
Try out new castes or strains that you might have passed up initially. You might find them to be surprisingly fun.
As an Alien, it is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that you have your abilities set up on hotkeys or macros. Ask for help if you don't know how.
Pouncing or lunging into a marine that's almost offscreen is not very wise. A marine with a shotgun may be right next to them.
Most alien deaths are caused by over-aggression, especially off weeds. Rein yourself in, or you may find yourself dying round after round.
You can spit at or shoot a welding fuel tank to blow it up next to hostiles.
Quickly rest if you're right next to an explosive about to blow, you'll absorb half the explosion damage. The same method can be used to avoid shrapnel from certain explosion types.
On grab intent, click vendors to knock them over. After a few seconds, they'll fall on their side and you can walk through them.
Unpowered shutters can be manually opened by clicking on them. The Queen can also open containment shutters, but this takes some time.
Moving through pipes is noisy and entering/leaving the vents has a noticeable visual and auditory cue.
If a fellow alien is stunned, be sure to drag them to safety.
On help intent, click a xenomorph who is on fire to pat them out. This works on marines too!
Frenzy increases your speed and damage, Recovery increases your health regeneration, and Warding increases the time you have until you bleed out in critical health.
Turn off your night vision to see light offscreen. This lets you know if a marine is nearby, but make sure they don't have Night-Vision goggles.
You can devour bursted corpses in order to transport them to the Spawn Pool or Egg Morpher easier.
The bigger you are, the more time it'll take to enter a tunnel.
Drag yourself onto a hole in a wall as a medium-sized or smaller xeno to pass through it.
Claymores have directional explosions. Set them off early by slashing them from behind.
If you have difficulty clicking marines, try using Directional Slashing, though there's no directional slashing for abilities.
You can diagonally pounce through the corners of fire as a Lurker or Runner without getting ignited.
When playing as xeno, consider aiming at the limbs instead of the chest. Marine armour doesn't protect the arms and legs as well as it does the body.
As xeno, you can break Night-Vision goggles that some marines wear on their helmets. Just aim for the head and slash until the goggles shatter.
